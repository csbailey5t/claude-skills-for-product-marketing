# Switch Interview Skill (Jobs-to-be-Done)

## Overview
This skill implements Bob Moesta's Switch Interview methodology — a structured approach to understanding *why* customers make purchase decisions by reconstructing the complete story of how they got from "I have a problem" to "I bought something new."

Most customer research asks what customers want. Switch Interviews ask what made them act. The difference is profound: wants are hypothetical; actions reveal real motivation.

## When to Use This Skill
- Building or validating positioning with real buyer language
- Understanding what "job" your product is actually hired to do
- Identifying the buying triggers that signal in-market readiness
- Understanding what makes customers leave competitors (and come to you)
- Uncovering anxieties that slow down purchase decisions
- Finding out who your real competition is (often not who you think)
- Developing messaging from actual customer vocabulary

## The Core Insight: Demand-Side vs. Supply-Side Thinking

**Supply-side thinking** (how most companies think):
"Here's our product, here are its features, here's why you should buy it."

**Demand-side thinking** (what Switch Interviews reveal):
"What was happening in the customer's life that made them willing to change? What anxieties made them hesitate? What finally pushed them over the edge?"

Customers don't buy products. They hire products to make progress in their lives. Understanding the job — the specific progress they're trying to make — is more predictive of behavior than any demographic or firmographic attribute.

## The Four Forces of Progress

Every purchase decision involves four forces pulling in two directions:

**Forces that drive switching (push toward new):**
1. **Push** — The frustration or inadequacy with the current situation that makes "doing nothing" uncomfortable
2. **Pull** — The attraction of the new solution and the better life it promises

**Forces that block switching (pull toward staying):**
3. **Anxieties** — Fears about the new solution: Will it work? Is it worth the hassle? What if it fails?
4. **Habits** — The comfort and inertia of the current way: "At least I know how this works"

A purchase happens when Push + Pull > Anxieties + Habits

**Why this matters for PMM:**
- Messaging that only increases Pull (product benefits) while ignoring Anxiety will stall decisions
- Strong Push (you're fed up with current situation) explains urgency — without Push, there's no motivation to change
- Habits are the most underappreciated force: people stay with bad solutions because change is hard
- Understanding which force is weakest in your pipeline tells you where to invest

## The Customer Timeline

Moesta's framework maps the customer's journey through five stages. Switch Interviews reconstruct this timeline in detail.

```
[First Thought] → [Passive Looking] → [Active Looking] → [Deciding] → [Consuming/Using]
```

**Stage 1: First Thought**
The moment the customer first thought "something has to change." What triggered this? What was happening in their life/work?

**Stage 2: Passive Looking**
The customer is vaguely aware they have a problem but isn't actively searching. They notice things they didn't notice before: an article, a conversation, an ad, a peer mentioning a tool.

**Stage 3: Active Looking**
Something happens that creates urgency. The customer starts actively researching. What event caused the shift from passive to active?

**Stage 4: Deciding**
The customer is comparing options and narrowing down. What factors matter most? What would disqualify an option? What gives them confidence to commit?

**Stage 5: Consuming/Using**
Post-purchase. Are they satisfied? Is the product doing the job they hired it for? What would cause them to rehire it — or fire it?

## Designing the Interview

### Who to Interview

**Best interview subjects for each learning goal:**

| Goal | Who to interview |
|------|-----------------|
| Understand why customers switch to you | Recent buyers (within 90 days of purchase) |
| Understand why customers leave competitors | Customers who switched from a named competitor |
| Understand why customers don't switch | Prospects who evaluated and chose a competitor or did nothing |
| Understand retention risk | Customers who almost churned but stayed |
| Understand actual churn | Recent churned customers |

**Ideal candidate profile:**
- Made the purchase decision recently (within 3-6 months for recall accuracy)
- Was personally involved in the decision (not just a user, but a buyer or influencer)
- Had alternatives they considered
- Can speak to their context before the purchase, not just what they think now

**How many interviews:**
- You typically see pattern saturation at 8-12 interviews per segment
- Don't interview 30 people before synthesizing — you'll drown in data
- 3-5 interviews per segment is enough to identify the first patterns; then decide whether to continue

**Important: Avoid surveys for this purpose.** Surveys capture what people say they did. Interviews capture the actual story of what happened. The difference is enormous.

### Setting Up the Interview

**Recruiting script:**
"I'd love to talk with you about your experience buying [category/product]. I'm not trying to sell you anything — I want to understand what led you to make this decision. I'm trying to understand the story from when you first started thinking about this problem to when you made your decision. Would you be willing to spend 45-60 minutes with me?"

**Before the interview:**
- Know the date of purchase (or decision)
- Have a loose timeline to anchor conversation
- Prepare to be silent — this is their story, not yours
- No leading questions about your product's features or value

## The Interview Guide

### Opening

**Set the stage:**
"I want to understand the full story of how you ended up [buying X / switching from Y / choosing Z]. I'm going to ask you to take me back in time and tell me the story of what was happening in your work/life when this came up.

There are no right answers. I'm not evaluating you or your decision. I want to understand your experience as it actually happened. Some of my questions might seem strange — just answer them as honestly as you can.

Let's start at the moment when you actually made the decision. Do you remember the day you decided to [buy / switch]?"

**Anchor the timeline:**
"Great. So that was [date]. Now I want to go all the way back to before that. When was the first time you thought 'something has to change about [the area this product addresses]?'"

### Section 1: Uncovering the Push — The First Thought

**Goal:** Find the moment the status quo became unacceptable.

Questions:
- "What was happening at that time that made you think something needed to change?"
- "Walk me through what a typical day/week looked like before this problem became apparent."
- "What was the specific moment when you thought 'this isn't working anymore'?"
- "Was there a specific event — a customer complaint, a missed deadline, a number that looked wrong?"
- "Was this a problem you'd had for a while, or did something change that made it worse?"

**Dig for specifics:**
- "You said it was frustrating — what specifically was frustrating? Can you give me an example?"
- "Who else was affected by this? How did you know they were frustrated?"
- "How long had this been going on before you started looking for alternatives?"

**What you're looking for:**
- The specific trigger event (not "we needed a better solution" but "our Q3 report was three weeks late for the third time")
- How long the pain existed before they acted (important for understanding urgency vs. tolerability)
- Who else was experiencing the push (understanding buying committee pain)

### Section 2: Passive vs. Active Looking

**Goal:** Understand what catalyzed the shift from "aware of problem" to "actively searching."

Questions:
- "After you first thought about this, what happened next? Did you start looking right away, or did some time pass?"
- "What made you shift from 'this is a problem' to 'I'm going to do something about this'?"
- "Was there a specific event that made this urgent?"
- "How did you first encounter [your product / the category]?"
- "What were you using before? What was your relationship with it?"

**Dig for specifics:**
- "You mentioned you'd been thinking about this for [X months]. What changed that made now the time to act?"
- "Did someone recommend something to you? Tell me about that conversation."
- "Did you see anything that caught your attention — an article, a demo, a conference?"

**What you're looking for:**
- The catalyst that turned passive awareness into active search
- The role of word-of-mouth vs. marketing channels (where did they learn about you?)
- How long the consideration window is for your category

### Section 3: The Consideration Process

**Goal:** Map who they looked at and what criteria they used.

Questions:
- "Once you decided to look for a solution, what did you do first?"
- "Who else did you consider? Who made the shortlist?"
- "What did you need the solution to do? What was non-negotiable?"
- "What would have immediately disqualified a vendor?"
- "Was this your decision to make alone, or were others involved?"
- "What did other people in the decision care about that you hadn't thought about?"

**Dig for specifics:**
- "You mentioned [Competitor] — what made them attractive? What made them fall off the list?"
- "What was your reaction when you first saw [your product]? What stood out?"
- "Was there a demo or trial involved? What was that experience like?"
- "Did you talk to any references or customers? What did you ask them?"

**What you're looking for:**
- Real competitive set (often different from what the sales team assumes)
- The most important evaluation criteria
- Who the buying committee members were and what each cared about
- Whether "do nothing" was a real option they considered

### Section 4: Anxieties — What Almost Stopped the Purchase

**Goal:** Surface the fears and hesitations that nearly blocked the decision.

Questions:
- "Before you made the final decision, were there things you were worried about?"
- "Was there a moment when you almost didn't go with [product]? What happened?"
- "What would have had to go wrong for you to walk away at the last minute?"
- "When you thought about switching from [current solution], what made you nervous?"
- "Was there anyone who pushed back on this decision? What were their concerns?"

**Dig for specifics:**
- "You mentioned worrying about [X]. How did you get past that?"
- "What would have given you more confidence to decide faster?"
- "When you thought about the implementation, what scenarios worried you?"
- "Was there anything you were hoping no one would ask you about this decision?"

**What you're looking for:**
- The anxieties that create friction in your pipeline
- What would have shortened the sales cycle if addressed proactively
- The skeptic's arguments — the person in the room who pushed back
- Implementation and adoption fears that are real but often unaddressed in marketing

### Section 5: Habits — The Inertia You Were Fighting

**Goal:** Understand what comfort or familiarity they were giving up by switching.

Questions:
- "What were you using before? How long had you been using it?"
- "What did you like about how things worked before?"
- "Was there anything about the old way that you were sad to leave behind?"
- "Who on your team was most attached to the old way? How did that conversation go?"
- "Were there processes or workflows built around the old solution that had to change?"

**Dig for specifics:**
- "You mentioned the team was comfortable with [old tool] — how did you help them get comfortable with the switch?"
- "Was there institutional knowledge or customization you'd built up that you'd lose?"

**What you're looking for:**
- The real cost of switching (not just price, but habit disruption)
- Who champions the status quo in the buying process
- What "good enough" looks like and why people stick with it

### Section 6: The Decision and First Use

**Goal:** Understand what finally pushed them to decide and whether you're doing the job they hired you for.

Questions:
- "Tell me about the moment you decided. What happened?"
- "Who made the final call? How did the decision process end?"
- "In the first few weeks of using [product], was it what you expected?"
- "What was the first moment you thought 'this was the right call'?"
- "Has there been a moment where you thought 'this isn't quite what I expected'?"

**What you're looking for:**
- The final push — what tipped the scales
- Whether the product is actually doing the job they hired it for
- The "aha moment" — what creates early confidence and retention
- Signs that the product is being hired for a different job than you intended

## Synthesizing What You Learn

### After 3-5 Interviews, Look for Patterns in:

**Push Patterns:**
- What specific events consistently appear as triggers?
- What's the minimum tolerable pain before action?
- How long does Push build before it leads to action?

**Pull Patterns:**
- What specific vision of progress attracted them?
- What language do they use to describe what they wanted?
- Which features were mentioned before they happened vs. discovered in use?

**Anxiety Patterns:**
- What fears appear in multiple interviews?
- Which anxieties are addressed in your current marketing vs. which are not?
- Which anxieties are specific to your category vs. your product?

**Habit Patterns:**
- What are people giving up? Is this consistently hard?
- Who are the internal champions of the status quo?
- What "good enough" threshold do you need to clear?

### The Jobs Statement

After synthesis, articulate the Job:

**Format:** "When [context/situation], I want to [progress/outcome], so I can [higher-order goal]."

**Example:**
"When my sales team is growing faster than my ability to train them, I want to know which accounts are already interested so I can focus our limited capacity on the best opportunities."

This is a Job. It's not a feature request. It's not a demographic. It's a specific situation + desired progress + higher motivation.

**Important:** Most products are hired for multiple jobs. Different customer segments may hire the same product for different jobs. The Switch Interview helps you understand which jobs actually drive purchase.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Anchor on specific events, not opinions** — "Walk me through what happened" beats "why did you choose us?"
- **Follow the energy** — When a subject gets animated or emotional, dig there
- **Let silence work** — After an answer, wait 3 seconds before asking the next question
- **Record with permission** — You cannot take good notes and conduct a good interview simultaneously
- **Synthesize after every 3-4 interviews** — Don't wait until you have 20 before looking for patterns

### Don'ts
- **Don't ask leading questions** — "Did you find our onboarding helpful?" is not a Switch interview question
- **Don't ask hypotheticals** — "What would make you switch?" is much weaker than "What made you switch?"
- **Don't ask about the future** — Switch Interviews are retrospective. Past behavior, not future intent.
- **Don't reveal your hypotheses** — You'll just get the answer you hoped for
- **Don't rush to the product** — The story before they found you is where the gold is

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Asking "why" too early**
"Why did you choose us?" immediately primes rational justification, not honest story
→ Solution: Ask "what happened" and "tell me about that time" before ever asking "why"

**Pitfall 2: Stopping at the "pull" — only hearing what they liked**
Interviews that only capture what attracted people to your product miss anxiety and habits
→ Solution: Explicitly ask about what nearly stopped the decision and what they were giving up

**Pitfall 3: Interviewing too recently acquired customers only**
New customers haven't had time to learn if the product does the job
→ Solution: Interview at 30-90 days post-purchase for honest appraisal, not 5 days in

**Pitfall 4: Interviewing advocates**
Your biggest fans will tell you what you want to hear
→ Solution: Include average customers and churned customers, not just NPS promoters

**Pitfall 5: Skipping synthesis to do more interviews**
10 unanalyzed interviews teach less than 5 analyzed ones
→ Solution: Synthesize after each batch of 3-5 before deciding whether more interviews are needed

## Interactive Approach

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **Clarify the research goal** — What decision will these interviews inform?
2. **Design the interview guide** — Which sections matter most for this goal?
3. **Plan the recruitment** — Who specifically should be interviewed?
4. **Coach the interview technique** — Practice the questions and follow-ups
5. **Guide synthesis** — After interviews are done, help identify push/pull/anxiety/habit patterns
6. **Draw implications** — Translate patterns into messaging, positioning, and product recommendations

## Skill Invocation Strategy

When invoked, guide the user through:
1. Clarifying what they're trying to learn and why
2. Identifying who to interview and how many
3. Adapting the interview guide for their specific context
4. Coaching on interview technique — how to follow the energy, when to probe
5. Structuring synthesis across interviews
6. Articulating the jobs being done and the four forces
7. Drawing specific implications for messaging, positioning, and sales

The goal is research that changes how the team thinks about their buyers — not a slide deck that confirms what they already believed.
