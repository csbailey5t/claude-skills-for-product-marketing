# Emily Kramer Fuel & Engine Marketing Framework Skill

## Overview
This skill implements Emily Kramer's fuel and engine framework for planning effective marketing campaigns. The framework divides marketing work into two interdependent components - fuel (what you say) and engine (how you distribute it) - and ensures both are planned together. Most marketing failures stem from creating fuel without distribution plans, or building distribution without compelling content.

## When to Use This Skill
- Planning a new marketing campaign or initiative
- Diagnosing why current marketing efforts aren't working
- Deciding what to prioritize in your marketing work
- Evaluating whether you have the right balance in your plans
- Identifying bottlenecks in marketing performance
- Creating quarterly marketing plans

## Core Framework: Fuel & Engine

### Fuel
**Definition:** Everything you say to your audience - the content, messaging, and creative you produce.

**Examples:**
- Website copy (short-form)
- Blog posts and articles (long-form)
- Ad images and videos
- Email campaigns
- Product messaging
- Social media posts
- Explainer videos
- Case studies
- Slide decks

**Key Characteristic:** Fuel is the "what" - what you're communicating.

### Engine
**Definition:** The channels, processes, tools, and metrics you use to get fuel out to your audience and track results.

**Examples:**
- Distribution channels (paid ads, SEO, email, social, partnerships)
- Marketing processes (campaign planning, content workflows)
- Tools and technology (CRM, marketing automation, analytics, ad platforms)
- Metrics and dashboards (how you measure and optimize)
- Promotion strategies and tactics

**Key Characteristic:** Engine is the "how" - how you deliver and measure.

## Core Principle: Custom-Built Interdependence

**"Your fuel needs to be custom-made for your engine and your engine needs to be custom-made for your fuel."**

This means:
- Fuel created without considering distribution channels will fail (great content no one sees)
- Engine built without considering content capabilities will fail (distribution channels with nothing valuable to distribute)
- What works for one company won't work for another - both must be tailored to your business, audience, and resources

## The Central Problem: Imbalance

**Most marketers over-index on one element, sacrificing the other.**

### Over-Indexing on Fuel
**Symptoms:**
- Creating tons of content
- Blog posts, whitepapers, videos piling up
- Thinking "we need more distribution"
- Content sits unused or underperforms
- Can't prove ROI of content efforts

**Root Cause:** Creating fuel without a distribution engine to get it to the right audience at the right time.

**Example:**
You produce 20 blog posts per month but have:
- No SEO strategy (posts don't rank)
- No email nurture engine (posts don't reach prospects)
- No paid promotion budget (posts don't get amplified)
- No sales enablement process (posts don't help close deals)

**Result:** Lots of fuel, no combustion.

### Over-Indexing on Engine
**Symptoms:**
- Channels set up and ready to go
- Ads running with mediocre creative
- Emails sending with weak messaging
- Thinking "we need better content"
- Distribution is working but conversion is terrible

**Root Cause:** Building distribution infrastructure without quality fuel to make it effective.

**Example:**
You have:
- Paid ad campaigns across 5 channels
- Email automation sequences set up
- Social media posting schedule
- But generic messaging that doesn't differentiate
- Weak creative that doesn't stop the scroll
- No compelling offer or narrative

**Result:** Distribution without substance.

## Diagnostic Framework

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Work

Ask yourself:
- What % of my time goes to creating content vs. distributing and optimizing it?
- What gets prioritized in my planning: content projects or channel optimization?
- When marketing underperforms, what do I blame: creative or distribution?
- Do I have a backlog of unused content or empty channels?

**Balanced State:**
- Roughly 50/50 split of effort between fuel creation and engine building
- Planning includes both content projects AND distribution strategies
- Performance analysis looks at both content quality and channel effectiveness

**Red Flags:**
- "I'll create the content first, then figure out distribution" (fuel-heavy)
- "I have the channels ready, just need better content" (engine-heavy)
- Content created without knowing where/how it will be distributed
- Channels set up without clarity on what content will fill them

### Step 2: Diagnose Your Imbalance

**If you're fuel-heavy:**
- You create content but have no clear path to audience
- New content projects are easy to start; distribution planning is an afterthought
- You can't answer "how many leads did that blog post generate?"
- Sales/customers don't know half the content you've created

**If you're engine-heavy:**
- Channels are set up but creative is weak
- You're repurposing the same content across everything
- Channel tests are easy; creating new compelling content is hard
- You know your funnel metrics but the content itself isn't compelling

### Step 3: Identify the Bottleneck

Ask:
- If I had perfect distribution, would my current content convert?
- If I had perfect content, would my current channels get it to the right people?
- Where do I hit friction: creating fuel or distributing it?
- What would make the biggest impact: better messaging or better reach?

**Common Bottlenecks:**

**Fuel Bottleneck:**
- "I could run more ads but my creative doesn't perform"
- "Email list is ready but I have nothing valuable to send"
- "Sales wants enablement content but I haven't created it"

**Engine Bottleneck:**
- "I create great content but no one sees it"
- "Case studies exist but aren't used in sales process"
- "Blog posts published but don't drive any pipeline"

## Planning Framework: The GACC Brief

**For every marketing initiative, complete a GACC Brief to ensure fuel/engine balance:**

### G = Goals
- What business outcome are we driving?
- What metrics will we move?

### A = Audience
- Who exactly are we targeting?
- What do they care about?
- Where are they in the buyer journey?

### C = Channel/Distribution
- What channels will we use?
- How will this fuel get distributed?
- What's the promotional plan?

### C = Creative/Content
- What's the core message?
- What format (blog, video, ad, etc.)?
- What's the offer or call to action?

**Example GACC Brief:**

```
Initiative: Developer-Focused Content Campaign

G - Goals:
- Generate 200 developer signups for free tier
- 20% conversion to paid within 60 days
- Establish thought leadership in [technical domain]

A - Audience:
- Backend engineers at Series A/B startups
- Currently using [competitor approach]
- Pain point: [specific technical problem]

C - Channel/Distribution:
- Hacker News (2 posts timed for max visibility)
- Dev.to and Medium cross-posts
- Email to 5,000 developer subscribers
- Paid promotion in newsletters (TLDR, Console)

C - Creative/Content:
- Technical deep-dive blog post (2,000 words)
- Working code examples in GitHub repo
- Comparison benchmark vs. existing approaches
- "Try it free" CTA with 5-minute quickstart
```

**Why GACC Works:**
Forces you to think through both what you'll create (Creative) and how it will reach people (Channel) BEFORE starting work. If you can't fill in the Channel section, you have an engine problem. If you can't fill in the Creative section convincingly, you have a fuel problem.

## Balancing Strategy

### Principle 1: Set Balanced Goals

**Set goals that force both fuel and engine work.**

**Unbalanced Goal:** "Publish 20 blog posts this quarter"
→ Fuel-only focus

**Unbalanced Goal:** "Launch 3 new paid channels this quarter"
→ Engine-only focus

**Balanced Goal:** "Generate 100 SQLs from content-driven channels this quarter"
→ Requires both compelling content (fuel) AND effective distribution (engine)

**Example Balanced Goals:**
- "Achieve 30% email click-through rate on nurture campaigns" (requires good emails AND good content to link to)
- "Generate $500K pipeline from paid ads at <$200 CAC" (requires effective channels AND compelling creative)
- "Get 50 qualified demo requests from SEO" (requires ranking content AND conversion-focused pages)

### Principle 2: Plan Projects with Balance

**In quarterly planning, explicitly track fuel vs. engine projects.**

**Unbalanced Quarter:**
```
Q2 Projects:
1. Rewrite website copy (fuel)
2. Create new case studies (fuel)
3. Launch customer newsletter (fuel)
4. Produce demo video (fuel)
5. Refresh brand guidelines (fuel)

Result: Lots of new content, no improvement in distribution
```

**Balanced Quarter:**
```
Q2 Projects:
FUEL:
1. Rewrite homepage and pricing pages
2. Create 3 customer case studies
3. Develop new demo video

ENGINE:
1. Launch paid social campaigns to promote case studies
2. Build email nurture sequence that uses new content
3. Implement attribution tracking for content touchpoints

Result: New content AND systems to distribute it effectively
```

### Principle 3: Map Fuel to Engine

**For each piece of fuel, identify the engine:**

| Fuel | Engine (How it reaches audience) |
|------|----------------------------------|
| Blog post on SEO best practices | - Optimized for search<br>- Promoted in email newsletter<br>- Shared in relevant Slack communities<br>- Used in sales enablement |
| Customer case study | - Featured in paid ads<br>- Sent to prospects in sales process<br>- Published on website testimonial page<br>- Shared on social media |
| Product demo video | - Embedded on homepage<br>- Used in outbound sales sequences<br>- Promoted via YouTube ads<br>- Shared in onboarding emails |

**If you can't fill in the engine column, you have a distribution problem.**
**If engine column is full but fuel is weak, you have a content problem.**

## Common Scenarios and Solutions

### Scenario 1: "I create tons of content but it doesn't drive results"

**Diagnosis:** Over-indexed on fuel, weak engine

**Questions to Ask:**
- Do I have SEO optimization for blog content?
- Are blog posts promoted beyond publishing?
- Does sales know content exists and how to use it?
- Do I measure content contribution to pipeline?

**Solution:**
- Pause new content creation for 4-6 weeks
- Build distribution systems for existing content
- Implement content promotion playbook
- Create attribution tracking
- Document content usage in sales process

### Scenario 2: "My ads are running but creative performance is terrible"

**Diagnosis:** Over-indexed on engine, weak fuel

**Questions to Ask:**
- When did I last refresh ad creative?
- Is messaging differentiated or generic?
- Does creative speak to specific audience pain points?
- Am I testing multiple creative approaches?

**Solution:**
- Invest in better creative production
- Develop messaging framework based on customer insights
- Create more creative variants to test
- Use actual customer language in ads
- A/B test different value propositions

### Scenario 3: "I'm a solo marketer - how do I balance?"

**Diagnosis:** Resource constraints require intentional balance

**Solution:**
- Use GACC briefs religiously - don't create fuel without distribution plan
- Repurpose fuel extensively (1 piece of content → many formats)
- Choose 2-3 channels max and do them well (engine constraint)
- Outsource either fuel creation or engine optimization, keep one in-house
- Measure ruthlessly to know what's working
- Don't try to do everything - pick your battles

### Scenario 4: "I don't know if my problem is fuel or engine"

**Diagnosis:** Need systematic diagnosis

**Solution Steps:**
1. **Test the fuel:** Show your best content to target audience members 1-on-1. Is their reaction "this is really valuable" or "meh"?
2. **Test the engine:** Promote mediocre content through your channels. Does it reach the right people? Do they see it?
3. **Look at metrics:** High impressions but low engagement = fuel problem. Low impressions but high engagement when people see it = engine problem.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Think in systems** - Every fuel should have a distribution engine; every engine should have quality fuel
- **Use GACC briefs** - Prevent fuel/engine imbalance by planning both upfront
- **Measure both** - Track content quality metrics AND distribution metrics
- **Repurpose strategically** - Maximize fuel value by distributing through multiple engine channels
- **Be honest about bottlenecks** - Don't create fuel if distribution is the issue (and vice versa)

### Don'ts
- **Don't create fuel without a distribution plan** - Content without audience is wasted effort
- **Don't build channels without compelling content** - Distribution without substance fails
- **Don't copy others' fuel/engine mix** - What works for Stripe won't work for your startup
- **Don't ignore the imbalance** - If you're 90% fuel, creating more fuel won't fix the problem
- **Don't assume more is better** - Sometimes less fuel with better distribution wins

## Interactive Diagnostic Approach

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **Diagnose current state** - Ask about resource allocation and what gets prioritized
2. **Identify the imbalance** - Push to determine whether they're fuel-heavy or engine-heavy
3. **Find the bottleneck** - What would make the biggest impact: better content or better distribution?
4. **Challenge assumptions** - "You say you need more content, but can you distribute what you have?"
5. **Create balanced plans** - Ensure initiatives include both fuel and engine components
6. **Map fuel to engine** - For every piece of content, ensure there's a distribution plan

## Example Diagnostic Dialogue Flow

**Claude:** "Let's diagnose your fuel/engine balance. What % of your marketing effort goes to creating content vs. distributing and optimizing it?"

**User:** "Probably 80% content creation, 20% distribution."

**Claude:** "That's fuel-heavy. Let's test if that's the bottleneck. When you publish content, do you have clear distribution channels that get it to your target audience? Or does it mostly just get published and hope people find it?"

**User:** "Honestly, we mostly publish and share on social. We don't have robust distribution."

**Claude:** "So you're creating fuel faster than your engine can distribute it. Before creating more content, what would happen if you paused new content for a month and focused on building distribution systems for your best existing content?"

**User:** "That feels scary - we'd have nothing new to show."

**Claude:** "But you have a backlog of good content no one's seeing. That's the imbalance. Your instinct is to create more fuel, but your actual bottleneck is engine. Let's build a distribution system for your top 10 pieces of content first. Then when you create new fuel, you'll have an engine to push it through."

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**Fuel/Engine works alongside:**
- **Positioning (April Dunford)** - Positioning informs fuel (what you say)
- **Strategic Narrative (Andy Raskin)** - Narrative is fuel; sales process is engine
- **Customer Research** - Research informs both fuel messaging and engine channel selection

**Sequencing:**
1. Get positioning right (defines target audience and differentiation)
2. Use positioning to create fuel (messaging, content)
3. Build engine to distribute fuel to target audience
4. Measure and optimize both fuel quality and engine effectiveness

## Key Metrics to Track

### Fuel Metrics
- Content engagement rate (time on page, video completion, email clicks)
- Conversion rate of content CTAs
- Sales usage of content (% of deals where content was used)
- Content quality score (audience feedback, NPS of content)

### Engine Metrics
- Channel reach (impressions, audience size)
- Distribution efficiency (cost per impression, cost per click)
- Attribution (which channels drive pipeline)
- Channel optimization (CTR, conversion rate by channel)

### Balanced Metrics (Require Both)
- **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)** - Requires compelling fuel AND effective distribution
- **Pipeline from marketing** - Requires valuable content AND channels that reach buyers
- **Cost per acquisition** - Optimizing requires both better creative (fuel) and better targeting (engine)
