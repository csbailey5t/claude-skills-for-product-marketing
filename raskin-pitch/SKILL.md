# Andy Raskin Strategic Narrative Framework Skill

## Overview
This skill implements Andy Raskin's 5-element framework for creating compelling sales pitches and narratives, based on his viral analysis of Zuora's sales deck and other breakthrough pitches. The framework shifts focus from product features to strategic storytelling that creates urgency and positions your solution as essential for success in a changing world.

## When to Use This Skill
- Creating a new sales deck or pitch narrative
- Revising underperforming sales presentations
- Developing product launch narratives
- Training sales teams on strategic selling
- Creating founder/executive pitch stories
- Repositioning products in competitive markets

## The Strategic Narrative Framework

A compelling strategic narrative consists of five elements that must flow in sequence:

1. **Name a Big, Relevant Change in the World** - Identify an undeniable shift affecting your audience
2. **Show There'll Be Winners and Losers** - Demonstrate diverging outcomes based on response to change
3. **Tease the Promised Land** - Paint a vision of success in the new world
4. **Introduce Features as "Magic Gifts"** - Position capabilities as enablers of transformation
5. **Present Evidence You Can Make the Story Come True** - Prove credibility through customer success

## Systematic Development Process

### Phase 1: Identifying the Big Change

**Key Principle:** Start with the world, not your product. The change must be undeniable, already happening, and create both urgency and high stakes.

Ask these questions:
- What major shift is affecting your target customers' industry or business model?
- What external forces are making the old way of working obsolete?
- What technological, economic, regulatory, or competitive change is undeniable?
- Why does this change create urgency? Why can't customers wait?
- Why does this change create high stakes? What's at risk?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Is the change about the world, not your company?
- Would your audience agree this change is real and significant?
- Does the change create genuine urgency (not artificial scarcity)?
- Is the change specific enough to be compelling, not vague like "digital transformation"?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- "Our industry is changing rapidly" (too vague)
- "Companies need to innovate" (not specific)
- Changes that are only visible to insiders (not undeniable)
- Changes that happened years ago (no urgency)

**Example Output:**
```
The Big Change for [Your Product]:

Change: The shift from product-led to usage-based pricing in B2B SaaS

Why it's undeniable:
- 60% of new SaaS companies launched in 2024 use usage-based models
- Snowflake, Twilio, AWS have proven this at scale
- Customers now expect to pay only for what they use
- Traditional annual contracts are increasingly rejected by buyers

Why it creates urgency:
- Competitors are already offering usage-based options
- Sales cycles are lengthening for annual contract vendors
- Buyers have budget flexibility to try usage-based alternatives

Why it creates high stakes:
- Companies not adapting risk losing market share
- Usage-based models can drive 2-3x faster growth
- The window to transition before competition dominates is narrowing
```

### Phase 2: Winners and Losers

**Key Principle:** Show the divergence. Make it clear that response to the change determines outcomes. This overcomes loss aversion by showing inaction has consequences.

Ask these questions:
- Who is thriving under the new conditions? What are they doing differently?
- Who is struggling or failing to adapt? What are they doing wrong?
- What specific outcomes separate winners from losers?
- What behaviors or capabilities distinguish the two groups?
- Can you use real company examples (named or anonymous)?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are the differences clear and stark?
- Are the winners doing something genuinely different, not just "doing it better"?
- Do the losers represent a path your audience might currently be on?
- Is the contrast compelling enough to create fear of being left behind?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Winners and losers based only on using/not using your product type
- Vague differences like "more agile" or "more innovative"
- No specific examples or outcomes
- Winners/losers framing that feels forced or unrealistic

**Example Output:**
```
Winners vs. Losers in Usage-Based Pricing Shift:

Winners (Adapters):
- Companies like Snowflake: 150% net revenue retention from expansion
- Faster sales cycles (30 days vs 6 months for annual contracts)
- Higher win rates against traditional vendors
- Customers start small, expand naturally
- Aligned incentives: vendor success = customer success

Losers (Resisters):
- Legacy SaaS vendors watching customer acquisition costs rise
- Forced to offer discounts to compete with usage-based flexibility
- Losing to competitors who let customers "try before they buy"
- Sales teams spending more time defending annual contracts
- Customers churning after contracts end due to lack of continuous value alignment

Key Difference: Winners embrace risk-sharing with customers; losers cling to predictable but increasingly rejected contract models.
```

### Phase 3: The Promised Land

**Key Principle:** Paint a desirable, aspirational vision of success in the new world. Make it feel achievable but not trivial—they'll need help (your help) to get there.

Ask these questions:
- What does success look like for customers who navigate this change successfully?
- What tangible business outcomes do they achieve?
- What new capabilities or advantages do they gain?
- How does their business operate differently?
- What does their team/company feel like day-to-day?
- Why is this vision desirable enough to overcome the pain of change?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Is this vision specific and tangible, not generic "success"?
- Does it feel aspirational but believable?
- Is it clearly better than both the status quo AND partial/inadequate responses?
- Does it naturally lead to "but how do we get there?" (setting up your solution)
- Is it described from the customer's perspective, not yours?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Generic benefits like "increased revenue" or "improved efficiency"
- Vision that's just "using our product"
- Outcomes that could happen without significant change
- Benefits that don't clearly connect to the earlier change/winners framing

**Example Output:**
```
The Promised Land for Usage-Based Pricing:

Your company operates with:

Business Model:
- Revenue that grows automatically with customer usage
- 130%+ net revenue retention from natural expansion
- Predictable growth from consumption trends, not renewal cliffs
- Sales cycles compressed from months to weeks

Customer Relationships:
- Perfect alignment: you succeed when customers succeed
- Customers advocate for you (because you only charge for value)
- Natural product-led growth as usage expands
- Minimal churn because pricing scales with customer needs

Internal Operations:
- Finance can forecast based on usage trends, not binary renewals
- Sales focuses on helping customers succeed, not defending contracts
- Product development driven by usage data showing real value
- Culture of customer obsession because growth depends on customer success

This is the new standard for B2B SaaS—and customers increasingly expect it.
```

### Phase 4: Features as Magic Gifts

**Key Principle:** Only now do you introduce your solution. Frame each capability as a "magic gift" that specifically helps customers reach the Promised Land you just described.

Ask these questions:
- What specific obstacles stand between customers and the Promised Land?
- What capabilities do you have that remove those obstacles?
- How does each feature directly enable the Promised Land outcomes?
- What makes your approach uniquely positioned to deliver this?
- What would be hard or impossible for customers to do without you?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are features introduced as tools for a journey, not ends in themselves?
- Does each capability clearly map to overcoming a specific obstacle?
- Are you showing how features work together as a system, not a feature list?
- Is the focus on customer transformation, not product superiority?
- Would a competitor struggle to make the same claims credibly?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Feature lists without connection to the Promised Land
- Generic capabilities that any competitor could claim
- Too many features (dilutes the narrative)
- Technical jargon instead of outcome language
- Features that solve problems you haven't established

**Example Output:**
```
Magic Gifts for Reaching the Promised Land:

Obstacle 1: "Our billing system can't handle complex usage-based pricing"
Magic Gift: Real-time usage metering and flexible pricing rules
→ Enables: Billing any usage pattern (seats, API calls, compute hours, transactions) without custom dev work

Obstacle 2: "We can't forecast revenue without annual contracts"
Magic Gift: Consumption analytics and predictive modeling
→ Enables: More accurate revenue forecasts than renewal-based models (predict usage trends vs. binary yes/no renewals)

Obstacle 3: "Usage-based pricing means unpredictable customer bills"
→ Magic Gift: Spend management controls and real-time visibility for customers
→ Enables: Customers control their spending while you capture expansion (eliminates "bill shock")

Obstacle 4: "Migrating existing customers seems impossibly complex"
Magic Gift: Hybrid pricing engine supporting both models during transition
→ Enables: Gradual migration without disrupting existing business

These aren't just features—they're the specific tools that make usage-based pricing practical for your business, not just theoretically attractive.
```

### Phase 5: Evidence and Proof

**Key Principle:** Prove you can deliver on the narrative with concrete evidence from customers who've reached the Promised Land using your solution.

Ask these questions:
- Which customers best exemplify the transformation you promise?
- What specific outcomes have they achieved?
- What was their starting point (ideally, similar to the prospect)?
- What metrics demonstrate their success?
- Can you share quotes that echo the Promised Land language?
- What patterns exist across multiple success stories?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are the examples specific and quantified, not vague testimonials?
- Do the customer stories mirror the journey you've described?
- Are the outcomes meaningful and verifiable?
- Do you have enough evidence to establish a pattern, not just cherry-picked examples?
- Are the customers recognizable or relatable to the audience?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Generic testimonials like "great product, great team"
- Outcomes that don't connect to the Promised Land
- Only one example (could be an outlier)
- Customers too different from the audience to be credible
- Metrics without context or comparisons

**Example Output:**
```
Evidence: Companies That Reached the Promised Land

Customer 1: DataFlow (Mid-market analytics SaaS)
Starting Point: Traditional annual contracts, flat growth, 85% retention
After 18 months with usage-based pricing:
- 145% net revenue retention (up from 85%)
- Average sales cycle down from 4 months to 3 weeks
- 40% of revenue now comes from product-led expansion
Quote: "We were terrified to move away from annual contracts. Now we'd never go back. Our customers love that they only pay for what they use, and we've never grown this fast." - CEO

Customer 2: CloudSecure (Enterprise security platform)
Starting Point: Losing deals to usage-based competitors
After 12 months:
- Win rate vs usage-based competitors up from 40% to 75%
- Implementation went from 6-month process to 2-week rollout
- Customers starting 60% smaller but expanding 3x faster
Quote: "Usage-based pricing was our competitive differentiator. Customers trust us more because we only win when they win." - CRO

Pattern Across 50+ Customers:
- Average NRR increase: +45 percentage points
- Sales cycle reduction: 50-70%
- Product-led expansion: 30-45% of revenue growth
- Customer churn: Down 40% on average

This isn't theory. This is the repeatable playbook that's working across our customer base.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Start with change, not product** - If you mention your company in the first 5 slides, restart
- **Make the change undeniable** - Your audience should nod along, not question if it's real
- **Use real examples** - Named companies, specific metrics, quoted outcomes
- **Create genuine urgency** - Show why acting now matters, not artificial scarcity
- **Connect everything** - Each section should flow naturally into the next
- **Focus on transformation** - The story is about the customer's journey, not your product
- **Test the narrative** - Does it resonate emotionally? Does it create urgency?

### Don'ts
- **Don't start with "About Us"** - No one cares until you've established why change matters
- **Don't list features** - Frame capabilities as enablers of transformation
- **Don't make it about technology** - Focus on business outcomes and strategic implications
- **Don't use generic change** - "Digital transformation" is not a narrative
- **Don't fake urgency** - "Limited time offer" is not the same as urgent market change
- **Don't skip evidence** - Claims without proof are just marketing fluff
- **Don't make it complicated** - The best narratives are simple and clear

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: The change is really about your product**
"The world is changing because companies need better [your product category]"
→ Solution: The change must be external and undeniable even to people who've never heard of you

**Pitfall 2: Winners/Losers feels forced**
Making up differences to fit your narrative rather than observing real market dynamics
→ Solution: Study real market outcomes. Talk to customers about who's succeeding and why

**Pitfall 3: The Promised Land is vague**
"Customers will be more successful and competitive"
→ Solution: Get specific. What does success look like day-to-day? What metrics change?

**Pitfall 4: Features disconnected from the journey**
Listing product capabilities that don't obviously solve the obstacles to the Promised Land
→ Solution: Explicitly map each capability to a specific obstacle. Make the connection obvious

**Pitfall 5: Weak or missing evidence**
Testimonials like "great product" or metrics without context
→ Solution: Share detailed customer journeys that mirror the narrative arc. Show the transformation

## Interactive Questioning and Critical Engagement

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **Challenge vague or generic claims** - Push for specificity
2. **Test the "undeniable" criterion** - Would the audience question this change?
3. **Ensure narrative coherence** - Does each element flow naturally into the next?
4. **Demand concrete evidence** - No hand-waving or hypotheticals
5. **Watch for inside-out thinking** - Catch when the narrative becomes about the company, not the customer
6. **Pressure-test urgency** - Is this truly urgent or just "nice to have"?
7. **Verify Promised Land desirability** - Is this vision compelling enough to justify the pain of change?

## Example Critical Dialogue Flow

**Claude:** "Let's start with the big change. What shift in the world creates urgency for your product?"

**User:** "Companies need to modernize their tech stacks."

**Claude:** "That's too vague—'modernization' could mean anything and has been happening forever. What specific, undeniable change are you seeing? What's different about the market today versus 2-3 years ago that your target customers would immediately recognize?"

**User:** "Well, our customers are moving from on-premise infrastructure to cloud."

**Claude:** "Better, but that migration has been happening for a decade. What's the urgency NOW? What recent shift makes this suddenly more critical? And more importantly—what's the consequence of not adapting? Why should someone care?"

**User:** "I guess it's not just about moving to cloud—it's that cloud costs are now spinning out of control. Companies migrated thinking they'd save money, but now they're spending 2-3x their on-premise costs."

**Claude:** "Now we're getting somewhere! That's specific and creates real urgency. Let's develop this: What's driving the cost explosion? Why is it happening now? And who's handling this well versus poorly?"

## Skill Invocation Strategy

When invoked, guide the user through the complete process:
1. Develop each of the 5 elements sequentially through questioning
2. Critically evaluate each response—push back on vague, generic, or unconvincing content
3. Ensure narrative coherence across all elements
4. Produce a complete narrative document at the end
5. Offer to help translate the narrative into slide structure or talk tracks

The goal is not to be polite—it's to create a genuinely compelling strategic narrative that transforms how customers see the market and your solution.
