# Creative Intent Interrogation Skill

## Overview
This skill helps creators develop crystal-clear intent for any creative work by interrogating four fundamental questions: Who is this for? What should they feel? What should they take away? What's the overall experience? Through persistent questioning, it pushes past vague intentions to specific, actionable creative direction.

## When to Use This Skill
- Starting a new creative project (article, video, presentation, campaign, design)
- Refining work that feels unfocused or generic
- Getting feedback that your work "doesn't land"
- Feeling uncertain about creative direction
- Before major revision or editing passes
- Teaching others to think more intentionally about their work
- When stakeholders say "make it more [vague adjective]"

## Core Philosophy

**Most creative work fails not from poor execution, but from unclear intent.**

Creators often jump to execution (writing, designing, filming) without deeply considering:
- The precise emotional response they want to create
- The specific person they're creating for
- The transformation or insight the audience should experience
- The journey the audience takes from beginning to end

This skill forces intentionality through relentless questioning.

## The Four Dimensions of Creative Intent

Every piece of creative work should have clarity on:

1. **WHO** - The specific audience (not demographics, but psychographics and context)
2. **FEELING** - The specific emotion you want to evoke (not generic "engaged" but precise feelings)
3. **TAKEAWAY** - What changes in the audience's mind (insight, belief, understanding, motivation)
4. **EXPERIENCE** - The journey from beginning to end (how feeling and understanding evolve)

All four must be coherent and mutually reinforcing.

## Dimension 1: WHO is this for?

### Initial Question
"Who exactly is this for?"

### Common Weak Responses
- "Anyone interested in [topic]"
- "Marketers" / "Engineers" / "Founders"
- "Our target demographic"
- "People who want to learn about [topic]"

### Challenge These Responses
**Claude should push back:**
- "That's a category, not a person. Who SPECIFICALLY?"
- "What's happening in their life right now that makes this relevant?"
- "What do they already believe about this topic?"
- "What's their emotional state when they encounter this?"
- "Why does this matter to them TODAY, not generally?"

### Good Responses Include
- **Context**: What's happening in their life/work right now
- **Existing beliefs**: What they currently think about the topic
- **Pain point**: What they're struggling with
- **Emotional state**: How they feel about the problem
- **Alternative actions**: What else they could do with their time/attention

### Example Dialogue

**User:** "This article is for product managers."

**Claude:** "That's 500,000+ people with completely different contexts. Let's get specific. What's happening in a product manager's work life right now that would make them care about this article?"

**User:** "They're trying to prioritize features."

**Claude:** "Okay, but that's constant. What SPECIFICALLY about prioritization is painful right now? What are they struggling with that they weren't struggling with last year?"

**User:** "I guess... they're being asked to justify priorities more rigorously because budgets are tight."

**Claude:** "Now we're getting somewhere. So this is for product managers who are facing increased scrutiny on their roadmap decisions due to budget constraints. What do they currently believe about how to justify priorities?"

**User:** "They think you need data and customer research."

**Claude:** "And what's insufficient about that approach right now?"

**User:** "The data is inconclusive and research takes too long when stakeholders want answers quickly."

**Claude:** "Perfect. NOW we know who this is for:

**Product managers at startups/growth-stage companies who:**
- Face tight budgets and increased scrutiny on roadmap decisions
- Have stakeholders demanding faster priority justification
- Find traditional data-driven methods too slow or inconclusive for current pace
- Feel pressured to make and defend decisions quickly

That's a real person in a real context. Now let's figure out what they should feel."

### Template: WHO
```
This is for [specific role] who:
- Context: [What's happening in their life/work right now]
- Current belief: [What they think about this topic]
- Pain point: [What's not working with their current approach]
- Emotional state: [How they feel - frustrated? overwhelmed? curious? skeptical?]
- At the moment when: [The specific trigger that brings them to this content]

NOT for: [Who this explicitly isn't for, to maintain focus]
```

## Dimension 2: FEELING - What should they feel?

### Initial Question
"What specific feeling do you want to create in the audience?"

### Common Weak Responses
- "Engaged"
- "Interested"
- "Informed"
- "Inspired"
- "Excited"

### Challenge These Responses
**Claude should push back:**
- "Everyone wants their audience engaged. What SPECIFIC emotion?"
- "Inspired to do what? What does inspiration feel like in this context?"
- "You can inform people and bore them. What feeling accompanies the information?"
- "Let's go deeper. Close your eyes. Imagine someone finishing this. What's the feeling in their body?"

### The Feeling Spectrum Exercise

**Ask:**
"I'm going to give you pairs of feelings. For each pair, which side does your work lean toward?"

- Calm ↔ Energized
- Confident ↔ Curious
- Validated ↔ Challenged
- Hopeful ↔ Urgent
- Entertained ↔ Enlightened
- Empowered ↔ Guided
- Relieved ↔ Motivated

**Then push deeper:**
"You said 'challenged.' What KIND of challenged? Like a puzzle to solve? Like your assumptions are wrong? Like you've been thinking too small?"

### Good Responses Include
- **Primary emotion**: The dominant feeling (specific, not generic)
- **Secondary emotion**: A nuance or progression
- **Physical sensation**: How it feels in the body
- **Cognitive state**: How their mind feels (clear? racing? focused?)
- **Contrast**: What they DON'T feel (that they might expect to feel)

### Example Dialogue

**User:** "I want them to feel inspired."

**Claude:** "Inspired is generic. A TED talk inspires. A sunset inspires. Your article shouldn't feel like either of those. What SPECIFICALLY should they be inspired to do or feel?"

**User:** "Inspired to try a new approach to prioritization."

**Claude:** "That's an action, not a feeling. Before they take action, what's the FEELING that motivates it? Is it relief that there's a better way? Excitement about possibility? Frustration with the old way that finally boils over?"

**User:** "Relief, I think. Like 'finally, someone gets it and there's a way out.'"

**Claude:** "Good! Relief is specific. But relief from what? And does it stay relief, or does it transform into something else as they read?"

**User:** "Relief from feeling like they're failing. And then maybe it turns into confidence that they can actually justify their decisions."

**Claude:** "Perfect. So the emotional journey is:
1. **Recognition** - 'This person understands my struggle' (validation)
2. **Relief** - 'There's a way out of this' (hope)
3. **Confidence** - 'I can actually do this' (empowerment)

That's a complete emotional arc, not just 'inspired.'"

### Template: FEELING
```
Primary Emotion: [Specific feeling - validated, challenged, relieved, etc.]

Why This Feeling:
[Why this emotion serves the audience and content]

Emotional Progression:
- Beginning: [How they feel at the start]
- Middle: [How feeling shifts]
- End: [How they should feel when finished]

NOT These Feelings: [Feelings to avoid - e.g., "not defensive, not overwhelmed, not panicked"]

Physical Sensation: [How this feels in the body - "chest opens up," "shoulders relax," "mind clears"]
```

## Dimension 3: TAKEAWAY - What should change in their mind?

### Initial Question
"When someone finishes this, what should be different in their mind?"

### Common Weak Responses
- "They'll understand [topic] better"
- "They'll know how to [action]"
- "They'll be aware of [thing]"
- "They'll have learned about [concept]"

### Challenge These Responses
**Claude should push back:**
- "Understanding isn't a takeaway. What SPECIFICALLY do they now understand that they didn't before?"
- "Knowledge of 'how to' isn't enough. What BELIEF changes?"
- "Awareness is passive. What do they now BELIEVE or DECIDE?"
- "If you could only change ONE thing in their mind, what would it be?"

### The Belief Shift Exercise

**Ask:**
"Complete this sentence:

**Before this, they believed: _____**
**After this, they believe: _____**"

The takeaway is the shift from before to after.

### Types of Takeaways

**Belief Shift:**
- Before: "Prioritization requires data"
- After: "Prioritization requires a framework for making decisions with incomplete data"

**Mental Model Update:**
- Before: "Marketing is fuel OR engine"
- After: "Marketing requires balanced fuel AND engine"

**Permission Granted:**
- Before: "I shouldn't ship without perfect information"
- After: "I can make defensible decisions with imperfect information"

**Reframe:**
- Before: "'No decision' means we need to sell better"
- After: "'No decision' means buyers are confused about alternatives"

**Capability Belief:**
- Before: "I don't know how to justify priorities under scrutiny"
- After: "I can use [specific framework] to justify priorities confidently"

### Good Responses Include
- **The shift**: What changes from before to after
- **Why it matters**: What this unlocks for them
- **What they'll do differently**: How behavior changes
- **What they'll stop doing**: What they'll abandon

### Example Dialogue

**User:** "They'll learn a new prioritization framework."

**Claude:** "Learning a framework isn't a takeaway—that's just information transfer. What BELIEF about prioritization should change?"

**User:** "That you don't need perfect data to make good decisions?"

**Claude:** "That's closer, but still vague. Let's get specific. What DO they need instead of perfect data?"

**User:** "A clear framework for making trade-offs."

**Claude:** "Okay, so the belief shift is:

**Before:** 'I need more data to make defensible priority decisions'
**After:** 'I need a clear framework for making trade-offs, even with incomplete data'

Now, what becomes possible for them with this new belief?"

**User:** "They can make decisions faster and defend them better."

**Claude:** "And what do they STOP doing?"

**User:** "Stop waiting for perfect research. Stop feeling guilty about making judgment calls."

**Claude:** "Excellent. Now we have a complete takeaway:

**Belief Shift:** From 'need perfect data' to 'need clear framework'
**Enables:** Faster decisions, better stakeholder communication
**Stops:** Analysis paralysis, research delay, guilt about judgment calls"

### Template: TAKEAWAY
```
The Belief Shift:
Before: [What they believed/thought/assumed]
After: [New belief/understanding/assumption]

Why This Matters:
[What this unlocks for them, what becomes possible]

Behavioral Change:
- Will START: [New actions or approaches]
- Will STOP: [Old behaviors they abandon]

The "Aha" Moment:
[The specific insight or realization - can you summarize in one sentence?]
```

## Dimension 4: EXPERIENCE - What's the journey?

### Initial Question
"Walk me through the experience from beginning to end. How do they feel and what do they understand at each stage?"

### Common Weak Responses
- "Introduction, explanation, conclusion"
- "Hook, value, call-to-action"
- "Setup, main content, wrap-up"

### Challenge These Responses
**Claude should push back:**
- "That's structure, not experience. What's the FEELING at each stage?"
- "How does their understanding EVOLVE?"
- "What questions form in their mind, and when do you answer them?"
- "Where do you challenge them? Where do you comfort them?"
- "What's the pacing—fast or slow? Where do you speed up or slow down?"

### The Experience Mapping Exercise

**For each third of the piece, ask:**

**Opening (First 10-20%):**
- What feeling do you establish?
- What question do you plant in their mind?
- What makes them want to continue?
- Do you validate them or challenge them first?

**Middle (60-80%):**
- How does understanding build?
- Where's the turning point?
- What resistance might they feel, and how do you address it?
- What's the rhythm—fast/slow, dense/spacious?

**Ending (Final 10-20%):**
- What's the final emotional note?
- What do you leave them with?
- What question do you answer, and what question do you leave open?
- What's the last thing you want them to think?

### Good Responses Include
- **Emotional pacing**: Where do you create tension vs. release?
- **Information pacing**: Where do you front-load vs. reveal gradually?
- **Tone shifts**: Where does tone change and why?
- **Reader questions**: What questions form in their mind, and when do you answer them?
- **Resistance points**: Where might they resist, and how do you handle it?

### Example Dialogue

**User:** "I introduce the problem, explain the framework, then show examples."

**Claude:** "That's an outline, not an experience. Let's go moment by moment. In the first 30 seconds, what FEELING are you creating?"

**User:** "Um... recognition that they're struggling?"

**Claude:** "Good. You're validating their pain. But do you START with that, or do you start with something else? What's the first sentence?"

**User:** "Maybe something like: 'Your stakeholder asks why Feature X should ship before Feature Y. You freeze.'"

**Claude:** "Excellent—that creates immediate recognition and a little discomfort. So you START with a moment of pain. Then what? Do you sit in that pain, or do you release it quickly?"

**User:** "I probably should release it quickly with hope that there's a solution."

**Claude:** "Okay, so:
- **First 10%**: Create recognition of painful moment (discomfort)
- **Next section**: Offer hope that there's a way out (relief)

What happens in the middle? Do you get into the framework immediately, or do you build context first?"

**User:** "I should probably explain WHY the data-driven approach fails first."

**Claude:** "So you're deepening the pain before offering the solution. That's a choice. Does that serve your emotional arc? Remember, you want to move from recognition → relief → confidence. Deepening pain might create frustration."

**User:** "Good point. Maybe I validate their struggle briefly, then pivot quickly to the framework."

**Claude:** "Better. So the experience is:

**Opening (0-15%):**
- Emotional: Recognition → Relief
- Cognitive: 'I'm not alone' → 'There's a solution'
- Moment: Painful freeze moment → Promise of framework

**Middle (15-80%):**
- Emotional: Curiosity → Understanding
- Cognitive: Learning the framework step-by-step
- Pacing: Medium—not rushed, but not dwelling

**Ending (80-100%):**
- Emotional: Confidence
- Cognitive: 'I can do this'
- Moment: Example of framework in action + permission to use it

That's an experience, not just an outline."

### Template: EXPERIENCE
```
Opening (First 10-20%):
- Emotional note: [What they feel]
- Cognitive state: [What they're thinking]
- The hook: [What pulls them in]
- Question planted: [What question forms in their mind]

Middle (60-80%):
- Emotional progression: [How feeling evolves]
- Understanding builds: [How comprehension develops]
- Pacing: [Fast/slow, dense/spacious]
- Resistance point: [Where might they push back, and how do you address it]

Ending (Final 10-20%):
- Final emotional note: [Last feeling]
- Resolution: [What question you answer]
- What you leave open: [What question or thought lingers]
- Last impression: [Final thing they think]

Overall Tone: [Conversational? Authoritative? Challenging? Supportive?]
Overall Pacing: [Fast-paced? Contemplative? Urgent? Spacious?]
```

## Coherence Check: Testing All Four Dimensions

Once all four dimensions are clear, test for coherence:

### Question 1: WHO → FEELING
"Does this feeling make sense for this audience?"
- If the audience is stressed and overworked, is creating "calm" the right feeling, or would "energized" better serve them?

### Question 2: FEELING → TAKEAWAY
"Does the emotional journey support the belief shift?"
- If you want them to believe "I can do this," does the emotional arc build confidence?
- If you want them to question assumptions, does the emotional arc create productive challenge?

### Question 3: TAKEAWAY → WHO
"Is this takeaway valuable to this specific audience?"
- Would the belief shift actually help them with their current struggle?
- Is this the most important thing they need to learn right now?

### Question 4: EXPERIENCE → ALL
"Does the journey deliver the feeling and takeaway to this audience?"
- Does the pacing match their patience level?
- Does the tone match their emotional state?
- Do you address their likely objections?

### Red Flags for Incoherence

**Mismatch: WHO vs. TAKEAWAY**
- Audience: Beginners
- Takeaway: Advanced strategic insight
→ Problem: Takeaway is too advanced for audience

**Mismatch: FEELING vs. EXPERIENCE**
- Desired feeling: Calm, clarity
- Experience: Rapid-fire dense information
→ Problem: Pacing creates anxiety, not calm

**Mismatch: TAKEAWAY vs. FEELING**
- Takeaway: "Challenge your assumptions"
- Feeling: Comfortable, validated
→ Problem: Can't challenge assumptions if they feel too comfortable

## Common Pitfalls and How to Challenge Them

### Pitfall 1: "This is for everyone"
**Challenge:** "If it's for everyone, it's for no one. Who SPECIFICALLY will get the most value?"

### Pitfall 2: "I want them to feel good"
**Challenge:** "Good is meaningless. Eating pizza feels good. Finishing a marathon feels good. Which kind of good?"

### Pitfall 3: "They'll learn [topic]"
**Challenge:** "Learning isn't a takeaway. What BELIEF changes? What becomes possible?"

### Pitfall 4: "The experience is intro, body, conclusion"
**Challenge:** "That's not an experience, that's a template. What do they FEEL at each stage?"

### Pitfall 5: Multiple competing intents
**Challenge:** "You're trying to do three things at once. Pick ONE primary intent."

### Pitfall 6: Intent that requires too much
**Challenge:** "You want them to feel 'challenged but not defensive'—that's a very narrow emotional target. Can you reliably hit it?"

## Interrogation Question Bank

Use these to push deeper:

### WHO Questions
- "What's happening in their life RIGHT NOW?"
- "What did they try before this that didn't work?"
- "What do they believe that's wrong or incomplete?"
- "Why NOW? What's changed?"
- "What else could they be doing with their time right now?"

### FEELING Questions
- "If you could only evoke ONE emotion, what would it be?"
- "What's the feeling in their body when they finish?"
- "What do they NOT feel that they might expect to?"
- "Does the feeling CHANGE during the experience, or stay constant?"
- "What feeling would be WRONG for this piece?"

### TAKEAWAY Questions
- "What's the ONE sentence summary of what changes in their mind?"
- "What belief do they walk in with? What belief do they walk out with?"
- "What will they do differently tomorrow?"
- "What will they STOP doing?"
- "If they remember only ONE thing in 6 months, what should it be?"

### EXPERIENCE Questions
- "What's the first 5 seconds like?"
- "Where do you speed up? Where do you slow down?"
- "Where might they get confused? How do you prevent that?"
- "Where might they want to quit? How do you keep them going?"
- "What's the last sentence they read? Why that?"

## Coherence Check
✓ Does the feeling serve this audience?
✓ Does the experience deliver this feeling?
✓ Does the takeaway justify the audience's time?
✓ Do all four dimensions reinforce each other?
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Push past first answers** - The first response is almost always too vague
- **Demand specificity** - No generic emotions, no broad audiences
- **Test coherence** - All four dimensions must reinforce each other
- **Use contrast** - Define what it's NOT as much as what it IS
- **Challenge assumptions** - If it sounds like a template answer, it probably is
- **Go deeper on feeling** - This is where most creators are weakest

### Don'ts
- **Don't accept "engaged" or "interested"** - These are non-emotions
- **Don't accept "everyone"** - Specific audience or it fails
- **Don't accept structure as experience** - Outline ≠ emotional journey
- **Don't let takeaway be vague** - "Learn about X" isn't a takeaway
- **Don't skip coherence check** - Four dimensions must align
- **Don't be satisfied quickly** - Keep pushing until it's crystal clear

## Example: Complete Interrogation

Let me show a full interrogation flow:

**Claude:** "What are you creating?"

**User:** "An article about product prioritization."

**Claude:** "Okay. Who is this for?"

**User:** "Product managers."

**Claude:** "That's hundreds of thousands of people in completely different situations. What's happening in a product manager's life RIGHT NOW that makes this relevant?"

**User:** "They need to prioritize their roadmap."

**Claude:** "That's always true. What's DIFFERENT or DIFFICULT about prioritization right now that wasn't true 6 months ago?"

**User:** "Budget cuts mean more scrutiny on every decision."

**Claude:** "Good! So this is for product managers facing increased scrutiny due to budget constraints. What do they currently believe about how to handle this scrutiny?"

**User:** "That they need more data to justify decisions."

**Claude:** "And is that belief serving them well?"

**User:** "No, because the data is usually inconclusive and stakeholders want faster answers."

**Claude:** "Perfect. So this is for:

**Product managers who:**
- Face increased budget scrutiny
- Believe they need more data to justify decisions
- Find that data is too slow or inconclusive
- Feel pressured to make and defend decisions faster

Now: what should they FEEL when they read this?"

**User:** "Inspired to try a new approach."

**Claude:** "Inspired is too generic. What SPECIFIC emotion? Is it relief that there's a better way? Confidence they can do it? Something else?"

**User:** "Maybe relief?"

**Claude:** "Relief from what exactly?"

**User:** "From feeling like they're failing or making unjustifiable decisions."

**Claude:** "Good. Does the feeling stay relief, or does it transform?"

**User:** "It should probably become confidence."

**Claude:** "So the emotional arc is: Recognition → Relief → Confidence. They recognize their struggle, feel relief that there's a solution, build confidence they can do it. Does that feel right?"

**User:** "Yes."

**Claude:** "Okay. What's the TAKEAWAY? What changes in their mind?"

**User:** "They learn a prioritization framework."

**Claude:** "That's information transfer, not a belief shift. What BELIEF changes?"

**User:** "That they don't need perfect data?"

**Claude:** "What do they need INSTEAD of perfect data?"

**User:** "A clear framework for making trade-offs."

**Claude:** "So the belief shift is:
- **Before:** 'I need more data to make defensible decisions'
- **After:** 'I need a clear framework for making trade-offs with imperfect data'

What does this enable them to do?"

**User:** "Make faster decisions and defend them better."

**Claude:** "And what do they STOP doing?"

**User:** "Stop waiting for perfect research."

**Claude:** "Excellent. Now, the EXPERIENCE. What's the first thing they encounter? What's the opening feeling?"

**User:** "Probably recognition of their struggle."

**Claude:** "Okay, so you create recognition—a moment they identify with. Do you sit in that pain or move quickly to hope?"

**User:** "Move quickly to hope."

**Claude:** "Good, because you want relief, not frustration. So:
- **Opening**: Recognition → Hope
- **Middle**: Learning the framework (building understanding and confidence)
- **Ending**: Confidence they can do this

How does that sound?"

**User:** "That makes sense."

**Claude:** "Now let's test coherence:
- Does this feeling (recognition → relief → confidence) serve THIS audience (PMs under pressure)? YES
- Does this experience deliver that feeling? YES
- Does this takeaway (framework over data) help this audience? YES
- Do all four dimensions work together? YES

You have clear creative intent. NOW you can start writing."

## Skill Invocation Strategy

When invoked, guide the user through:
1. Interrogate WHO with relentless specificity
2. Interrogate FEELING until it's visceral and specific
3. Interrogate TAKEAWAY until the belief shift is clear
4. Interrogate EXPERIENCE until the journey is vivid
5. Test coherence across all four dimensions
6. Output complete creative intent document

The goal is clarity so complete that the creator could hand this document to someone else and they could execute the vision.
