# Category Design Skill

## Overview
This skill implements the category design framework from *Play Bigger* by Al Ramadan, Dave Peterson, Christopher Lochhead, and Kevin Maney — the discipline of creating a new market category, defining it on your terms, and becoming its dominant company.

Category design isn't for everyone. It's for companies who have something genuinely new: a different approach, a different problem framing, or a combination of capabilities that don't fit neatly into existing categories. When done well, category design lets you become the category king — the company that captures 70-80% of the economics in a market it defined.

## When to Use This Skill
- Your product doesn't fit cleanly into any existing category — and existing category positioning hides your value
- You're consistently losing deals because buyers are comparing you to the wrong alternatives
- Your differentiation is architectural or philosophical, not just feature-level
- You want to define the problem before competitors do
- You're doing Dunford-style positioning and keep reaching the conclusion "we need a new category"
- You're a founder building a company narrative, not just a product pitch

## When NOT to Use This Skill

Category design is high-risk, high-reward. Don't attempt it if:
- You're competing in a well-defined, established category where "better" is a viable strategy
- You don't have sufficient resources to educate a market over 2-3 years
- Your product genuinely fits an existing category and customers understand it naturally
- You want short-term pipeline results (category design is a 2-3 year investment)

If you're mainly looking for positioning and messaging, `/dunford-positioning` and `/messaging-architecture` may serve you better.

## The Category Design Framework

Category design consists of five interconnected elements:

1. **The Problem** — Define a problem that doesn't have a name yet
2. **The Point of View (POV)** — Articulate the world view that makes your approach inevitable
3. **The Category Name** — Name the new market you're creating
4. **The Ecosystem** — Map all the players who have a stake in the category succeeding
5. **The Lightning Strike** — Design the moment that puts the category on the map

## Core Principle: Category Kings vs. Category Competitors

**Category kings** define the problem, name the category, and become the default answer. They capture 70-80% of market cap, even as "better" competitors emerge.

**Category competitors** fight for the remaining 20-30%. Even if their product is better, they're permanently playing catch-up in a market someone else defined.

The goal of category design is to be the Salesforce, not the Siebel. The Uber, not the first taxi app. The company whose name becomes synonymous with the category.

**Why this works:**
Buyers take cognitive shortcuts. Once a category exists with a leader, they evaluate everyone else against that leader. If you let someone else define the category, you're forever explaining how you compare to them. If you define the category, you set the comparison criteria.

## Systematic Development Process

### Phase 1: The Problem

**Key Question:** What problem exists in the world that doesn't have a name yet?

Category design starts with a problem, not a product. The problem you name has to:
- Be real and acute for the customers you're targeting
- Exist independently of your product (the problem was there before your solution)
- Currently have no satisfying solution (or the existing solutions are creating the problem)
- Be important enough that a market would form around solving it

**The Problem Framing Exercise:**

Ask:
- "What's broken in how [customers] do [something important]? What's the hidden cost of that?"
- "What do customers tolerate today that they shouldn't have to tolerate?"
- "What does everyone in [industry] do that doesn't make sense but no one questions?"
- "What outcome is everyone trying to achieve that current solutions fail to reliably deliver?"
- "What would be obviously better — if it existed?"

**Critical evaluation:**
- Is this a real problem that exists without your product? (If the problem only exists with your product, it's not a category problem — it's a product problem)
- Is the cost of the problem significant enough to build a market around? (small problems make small categories)
- Do you have evidence that customers experience this problem, even if they don't articulate it exactly this way?
- Is this problem currently named? If yes, what's the existing category and why is it inadequate?

**Red Flags:**
- The problem is "people need better X" — that's competitive positioning, not a new problem
- The problem is visible only from inside your company
- The problem only matters to a tiny segment
- Existing category names already describe this problem acceptably

**Example Output:**
```
The Problem for [Company]:

Old frame (what the market currently calls this):
"Companies need better [existing category]."

Why that framing is wrong:
The existing category assumes [flawed assumption]. It optimizes for [wrong thing].
Customers who succeed don't do it by getting better at the old way —
they do it by [different approach].

New problem frame:
"[Companies/teams/people] are [activity] in a world where [condition has changed],
and [current approaches] were designed for a world that no longer exists.
The result: [consequence that everyone recognizes but no one has named]."

Evidence this problem is real:
• [Specific data point]
• [Customer quote or behavior]
• [Market trend that validates the problem]

Why solving this is important:
[What becomes possible when the problem is solved]
```

### Phase 2: The Point of View

**Key Question:** What do we believe about the world that, if true, makes our approach inevitable?

The Point of View (POV) is not a product pitch. It's a declaration of how the world is changing, why existing approaches are inadequate, and what the right response looks like. It's the intellectual foundation of your category.

A strong POV:
- Names a shift in the world (technology, behavior, economics, regulation)
- Explains why the old way worked in the old world but fails in the new one
- Paints a vision of what success looks like for companies that embrace the new way
- Positions your approach as the natural response to the shift

**Structure of a POV:**

**The World Has Changed:**
[What fundamental shift has occurred that your customers are experiencing]

**The Old Way No Longer Works:**
[Why approaches built for the old world now create problems in the new one]

**The New Way:**
[What the right approach looks like — described in terms of outcomes and principles, not your specific product]

**The Stakes:**
[What companies that get this right will achieve vs. companies that don't adapt]

**Relationship to Raskin's Strategic Narrative:**
Andy Raskin's framework (see `/raskin-pitch`) and category design's POV cover similar territory. The key difference: Raskin's narrative is designed for sales pitches; the POV is a public declaration meant to recruit an entire ecosystem, educate a market, and define a category. The POV is bigger and longer-lived.

**Questions to develop the POV:**
- "What's the shift in the world that makes our approach more relevant today than 5 years ago?"
- "What's the belief that separates companies that will succeed from companies that won't in this new environment?"
- "What does the world look like when this category is mature and everyone does things the new way?"
- "If we published our POV and a smart prospect read it, would they immediately recognize it as true — even if they hadn't articulated it before?"

**Example POV Structure:**
```
The [Shift]: [What has fundamentally changed in the world]

For decades, [companies/people] have [old approach]. This made sense when [old
world condition]. But [the shift] has changed everything.

Today, [old approach] creates [new problem it didn't create before]. The data is
clear: [evidence]. And yet most [companies/people] are still [doing old thing].

The companies who will win in the next decade will [new approach]. Not because
it's newer, but because it's designed for how [the environment actually works now].

[Vision of what the new world looks like when the right approach is deployed].

At [Company], we built our entire approach around this belief.
```

### Phase 3: The Category Name

**Key Question:** What do we call this new space?

The category name is strategic, not just descriptive. It should:
- Signal the new problem you're solving
- Differentiate from adjacent categories without requiring a long explanation
- Be memorable enough that prospects can repeat it
- Be broad enough to expand into, narrow enough to own

**Naming approaches:**

**Outcome-based:** Name the category for what customers achieve
- "Revenue Intelligence" (outcome: smarter revenue decisions) vs. "Sales Analytics" (what the tool does)

**Problem-based:** Name the category for the problem you're solving
- "Cloud Cost Management" (the problem) vs. "FinOps" (more category-native term)

**Architectural/approach-based:** Name the category for the new way
- "Product-Led Growth" (the approach) vs. "SaaS Marketing" (too broad)

**Testing a category name:**
- Can your target customer hear the name and understand roughly what it addresses?
- Does it signal something meaningfully different from the adjacent categories?
- Is it trademarkable or ownable — not already taken by a large incumbent?
- Can you build a coherent Wikipedia article around it in 3 years?
- Would analysts adopt this name? (Analyst adoption is a major signal of category traction)

**Warning: Category names take time.**
Don't expect customers to immediately understand a new category name. You're investing in a 2-3 year education campaign. The question isn't "do people understand it today?" but "will they understand it when the market matures?"

**Questions to develop the category name:**
- "What 2-3 word phrase best describes the problem we're solving?"
- "If there were a Gartner Magic Quadrant for this, what would it be called?"
- "What would the Wikipedia article title be?"
- "Is there a phrase we're already using internally that customers are adopting?"

### Phase 4: The Ecosystem

**Key Question:** Who else has a stake in this category succeeding, and how do we activate them?

Category kings don't succeed alone. A mature category has an ecosystem of players who all benefit from the category growing:
- **Customers** who need the problem solved
- **Partners** whose products work better when combined with yours
- **Analysts** who cover the category
- **Press** who write about it
- **Investors** who fund it
- **Practitioners** who specialize in it
- **Adjacent vendors** who serve the same buyers
- **Thought leaders** who educate the market

**The ecosystem design exercise:**

Map all the players who benefit if your category succeeds and describe their stake:

```
Ecosystem Map for [Category Name]:

Customers:
• [Segment]: They benefit because [specific value to them]
• [Segment]: They benefit because [specific value to them]

Technology Partners (better together):
• [Partner type]: When [category] + [partner type] combine, customers get [outcome]
• Why they'd invest in this: [Their business benefit from category growth]

Service Partners:
• [Consultant/Agency type]: [Why they'd build a practice around this category]

Analysts:
• [Coverage area]: [Why this fits their coverage and why they'd embrace the category]

Press:
• [Beat/publication]: [Why this is a story they'd cover]

Investors:
• [Stage/focus]: [Why this category would attract capital]

Practitioners/Community:
• [Job title or role]: [Why they'd build identity around this category]
```

**Ecosystem activation questions:**
- "Who are the 10 partners who would benefit most if this category grew?"
- "Which analysts cover adjacent spaces and would logically extend to cover this?"
- "Are there practitioners (consultants, community leaders) who'd embrace this?"
- "What's in it for each player — specifically?"

### Phase 5: The Lightning Strike

**Key Question:** What's the single moment that puts this category on the map?

A lightning strike is a concentrated, coordinated event that makes the category real in the market's mind. It's not a campaign — it's a moment. Everything your company does is a slow burn of education. The lightning strike is the ignition.

**Examples of lightning strikes:**
- A company-defined event: Salesforce's "No Software" protest at Siebel's conference
- An industry conference keynote that declares the category
- A research report that names and quantifies the category
- A high-profile customer announcement that validates the problem
- A manifesto or book that defines the category intellectually
- A bold PR moment that creates earned media around the category narrative

**Lightning strike design principles:**

**Air war + ground war together:**
The lightning strike works through coordinated external visibility (air war: press, social, earned media) and direct customer/ecosystem engagement (ground war: events, partner activation, direct outreach). One without the other doesn't work.

**Timing matters:**
Lightning strikes work when the market is ready. Too early and it's ignored. Too late and someone else captures the moment. The best time is when the problem is widely felt but the category hasn't yet crystallized.

**Category, not product:**
The lightning strike should be about the category and problem, not your product. Salesforce protested at Siebel's conference — they weren't demoing their product, they were making a statement about a category change.

**Questions to design the lightning strike:**
- "What event or moment would make analysts, press, and customers all suddenly aware this category exists?"
- "What's the boldest thing we could do to say 'this old way is dead'?"
- "What's the first thing we'd want every target customer to have seen/read/heard about this category?"
- "Is there a partner, customer, or co-creator who would make this bigger if they were part of the moment?"
- "What would make investors, analysts, and press all write about this category in the same week?"

**Planning the lightning strike:**

```
Lightning Strike Design:

The Event: [What is the moment]
The Message: [What the market will understand after the strike]
Format: [Conference keynote / research report / event / stunt / launch]
Timing: [Why now is the right time]

Air war (earned media + social):
• [Press outreach plan]
• [Analyst briefing plan]
• [Social/influencer component]

Ground war (direct ecosystem activation):
• [Customer / partner event or announcement]
• [Community activation]
• [Sales enablement alignment]

Success criteria:
• [What does "it worked" look like at 30 days?]
• [Category language being adopted by third parties?]
• [Analyst coverage of the new category?]
```

## The Category Design Flywheel

Once the lightning strike is executed, category momentum builds through a flywheel:

```
POV creates awareness
→ Awareness attracts customers and partners
→ Customers and partners create proof
→ Proof attracts analysts and press
→ Analysts and press validate the category
→ Validation attracts more customers and competitors
→ Competitors' entry proves the category is real
→ Category king captures most of the value
```

**The counterintuitive truth about competitors:**
When competitors enter your category, they're validating it. Category kings welcome competition because it means the market is growing. The risk is if you've waited too long to establish your dominance.

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Start with the problem, not the product** — If the problem doesn't make sense without your product, it's not a category problem
- **Be willing to educate the market** — Category creation requires patience; budget for 2-3 years
- **Recruit your ecosystem early** — Partners and analysts who help define the category will advocate for you when competitors arrive
- **Name the category yourself** — If you don't name it, someone else will
- **Welcome competitors** — They validate the category; your job is to remain the defining player

### Don'ts
- **Don't attempt category design if you don't have something genuinely new** — Positioning in an existing category is faster and lower risk for most companies
- **Don't make the category about your product** — Category design that's really just product marketing won't create a category
- **Don't use insider language in your POV** — The POV must be legible to a smart outsider
- **Don't expect immediate pipeline** — Category design is a 2-3 year investment; expect confusion before clarity
- **Don't confuse a narrative with a category** — A good story is necessary but not sufficient; you need ecosystem proof

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Category design as rebranding**
Renaming what you do without changing how you frame the problem
→ Solution: Start with the problem you're naming, not the name you want for your product

**Pitfall 2: POV that's really a product pitch**
"We believe in [our product approach]" — that's differentiation, not a world view
→ Solution: The POV should be true even if your company didn't exist

**Pitfall 3: Category name nobody understands**
Coining a term so novel that even sophisticated buyers are confused
→ Solution: Test the name with 10 target customers. If more than half are deeply confused, simplify.

**Pitfall 4: Lightning strike without ecosystem**
A flashy event with no partners, no analysts, no customers to amplify it
→ Solution: Build the ecosystem before the lightning strike, not after

**Pitfall 5: Category design without commitment**
Starting category design and retreating to competitive positioning when results are slow
→ Solution: Decide before you start. Category design requires 2-3 year commitment at the exec level. If that's not available, pursue competitive positioning instead.

## Interactive Approach

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **First, test if category design is right** — Does the product genuinely fit poorly in existing categories?
2. **Develop the problem frame** — What's the problem that doesn't have a name? Push for specificity.
3. **Build the POV** — What belief, if shared by the market, makes your approach inevitable?
4. **Pressure-test the category name** — Is it memorable, differentiated, and expandable?
5. **Map the ecosystem** — Who has a stake in this category succeeding?
6. **Design the lightning strike** — What's the moment that makes the category real?
7. **Challenge premature category creation** — If the product fits an existing category, say so directly.
