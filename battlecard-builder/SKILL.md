# Competitive Battlecard Builder Skill

## Overview
This skill helps product marketers build competitive battlecards that win deals. Most battlecards fail because they dump features and comparisons onto a page that no one reads under pressure. This framework builds battlecards backwards from the sales rep's experience: what do they need to hear, say, and do when a specific competitor comes up?

## When to Use This Skill
- A competitor is showing up in 10%+ of deals
- Sales reps are asking "what do I say when [Competitor] comes up?"
- Win rates against a specific competitor are declining
- A competitor just announced something significant
- Building a competitive battlecard program from scratch
- Refreshing battlecards that reps have stopped trusting

## The Core Problem with Most Battlecards

**Most battlecards are built for product marketers, not sales reps.**

They contain:
- Exhaustive feature comparison matrices
- Technical specs without business context
- Company history and funding information nobody needs in a sales call
- Defensive, cautious language that doesn't help reps win

**What reps actually need:**
- What to say when the competitor's name is mentioned
- What questions to ask to expose competitor weaknesses
- Why customers who chose you over this competitor made that decision
- What proof they can cite in the moment

A good battlecard fits on 1-2 pages and gives reps confidence, not more information.

## The Seven-Section Battlecard Framework

Every battlecard covers these sections in order of rep utility:

1. **Competitor's Own Pitch** - How they position themselves
2. **Why Customers Choose Them (Honestly)** - Their real strengths
3. **Their Weaknesses** - Where they fall short
4. **Our Differentiated Value** - What only we can credibly claim
5. **Discovery Questions** - Landmines to plant early
6. **Talk Tracks** - What to say when it comes up late
7. **Proof Points** - Evidence to cite

## Systematic Development Process

### Phase 1: Understanding the Competitor

**Key Question:** How does this competitor position themselves to buyers?

Ask these questions:
- What does their website say their main value proposition is?
- What category do they claim to be in?
- What problems do they say they solve?
- Who are their named customers and in what segments?
- How do they describe themselves in analyst reports, G2, Capterra?
- What's their pricing model?

**Important Notes:**
- Read their website and marketing materials directly, don't rely on secondhand intel
- Look at their recent job postings to understand strategic direction
- Check G2, Trustpilot, or Capterra for how they describe themselves vs. what customers say
- Look for where they avoid being specific — that often reveals weaknesses

**Example Output:**
```
How [Competitor] Positions Themselves:

Headline: "The all-in-one platform for [category]"
Target customer: Mid-market teams of 50-500
Main claims: Faster implementation, simpler pricing, native integrations
Category claim: [Category name they use]
Recent emphasis: Enterprise expansion, AI features announced Q3
Price point: $X/seat/month (confirmed from their pricing page)
```

### Phase 2: Their Honest Strengths

**Key Question:** Why do customers genuinely choose them over us?

This is the most important section to get right — and the most uncomfortable.

Ask these questions:
- When we lose to this competitor, what do prospects say?
- What do reviews on G2/Capterra praise about them?
- What do their customers love that we can't honestly match?
- Are there segments where they are objectively better suited?
- What do former customers of ours who switched to them say?

**Important Notes:**
- Resist the urge to minimize their strengths — reps will encounter the real thing
- If they have a genuine strength, acknowledge it directly in the battlecard so reps aren't blindsided
- Honest competitive intel builds rep trust in the entire battlecard

**Example Output:**
```
Why Customers Genuinely Choose [Competitor]:

✓ Faster implementation (truly — 2-3 weeks vs. our 6-8 weeks)
✓ Lower entry price point (can be 40-60% cheaper for small teams)
✓ Stronger in [specific vertical] with purpose-built features
✓ Simpler UI — lower learning curve for non-technical users
✓ Better mobile app (we hear this consistently in reviews)

When They're the Right Choice:
- Teams under 25 people who don't need [our key differentiator]
- Companies in [specific vertical] that need [their specialty feature]
- Budget-constrained teams who need to get started quickly with basics
```

### Phase 3: Where They Fall Short

**Key Question:** What are their real, provable weaknesses that matter to buyers?

Ask these questions:
- What do their negative reviews on G2/Capterra consistently say?
- What do customers who switched FROM them to us say?
- What use cases can they not handle?
- What does their pricing do at scale?
- What integration or security limitations do they have?
- What does "simple" cost them at the enterprise level?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Every weakness must be verifiable and specific — not "less powerful" but "cannot do X without Y workaround"
- Connect each weakness to a customer outcome, not just a feature difference
- Avoid weaknesses your reps can't articulate clearly in 10 seconds

**Example Output:**
```
Where [Competitor] Falls Short:

⚠ Scalability ceiling: [Specific limitation with evidence]
   Impact: Customers outgrow them at [threshold], which is why [X customers] switched to us

⚠ [Feature gap]: Cannot do [specific thing] natively
   Impact: Requires [workaround] that adds [hours/cost/risk]

⚠ Pricing inflection: Their per-seat model becomes significantly more expensive at [threshold]
   Impact: Sticker shock at renewal for growing teams; average cost at 100 users is $X vs. our $Y

⚠ Support model: Community-only below [tier], no dedicated CSM
   Impact: Customers who need hands-on implementation support don't get it

⚠ Security/compliance: Not [specific cert they lack]
   Impact: Disqualified for regulated industries or enterprise security reviews
```

### Phase 4: Our Differentiated Value in Context

**Key Question:** What can we credibly claim against this specific competitor that prospects will believe?

This is NOT your general positioning — it's your positioning *relative to this competitor*.

Ask these questions:
- Which of our unique attributes directly address their weaknesses?
- What outcomes do customers get from us that they can't get from this competitor?
- What's the one thing we can say about ourselves that this competitor cannot say?
- What proof do we have that specifically came from customers who considered or switched from this competitor?

**Important Notes:**
- "We're better" is not differentiated value. Name the specific capability and the specific outcome.
- If you don't have customer proof specifically against this competitor, that's a gap to fill
- Keep to 3-4 points maximum — reps won't remember more

**Example Output:**
```
What We Have That [Competitor] Doesn't:

1. [Specific capability]
   Why it matters against them: [Competitor] requires [workaround]. We [outcome] natively.
   Proof: "[Customer quote]" — [Customer], [Role] at [Company]

2. [Specific capability]
   Why it matters against them: Their [limitation] means [customer consequence]. Our approach [outcome].
   Proof: [Customer] switched from [Competitor] and [specific metric improvement]

3. [Specific capability]
   Why it matters against them: As teams scale past [threshold], [Competitor's limitation] becomes [cost/risk/burden]. We [how we handle it].
   Proof: [Customer] at [size] achieved [outcome]
```

### Phase 5: Discovery Questions (Landmines)

**Key Question:** What questions can a rep ask early in the process that set up our advantages before the competitor is even mentioned?

Good discovery questions serve double duty: they uncover real pain *and* frame evaluations in our favor.

Ask these questions:
- What does the prospect need to *care about* for our differentiation to matter?
- What pain would they experience with the competitor that they may not know to look for?
- What buying criteria, if established early, would favor us?
- What do customers who switched FROM this competitor wish they'd asked earlier?

**Important Notes:**
- Questions should feel natural, not like traps
- Great discovery questions uncover legitimate pain that the rep can help with, regardless of competitive outcome
- Reps should use these questions whether or not the competitor has been mentioned yet

**Example Output:**
```
Discovery Questions to Ask Before [Competitor] Comes Up:

"When you think about where this initiative needs to be in 18 months, what would make it a success at 2-3x current scale?"
→ Surfaces scalability requirements that [Competitor] can't meet

"How much of your team's time is currently spent on [manual process we automate]?"
→ Quantifies the cost of [Competitor's] manual workflow gap

"What other tools is this solution going to need to connect with? Is that a day-1 requirement or can it come later?"
→ Surfaces integration requirements where we're stronger

"What happened with the last vendor evaluation you ran? What made the winner the winner?"
→ Reveals buying process and prior experience with [Competitor] or similar tools

"Has anyone on your team used [Competitor] at a previous company?"
→ Surfaces advocates or detractors early, gets stories on the table
```

### Phase 6: Talk Tracks for When They Come Up

**Key Question:** What does a rep say when a prospect says "we're also looking at [Competitor]"?

Different situations require different approaches:
- **Early in process**: Reframe evaluation criteria
- **Mid-process**: Acknowledge and redirect
- **Late in process (losing ground)**: Direct comparison + proof

**Example Output:**
```
When [Competitor] Comes Up:

EARLY (discovery/demo stage):
"We hear that often. They're a solid option for [honest acknowledgment of where they're good].
A few things worth exploring together: [insert 1-2 discovery questions from Section 5].
Where you land on those usually tells you which is the better fit."

MID-PROCESS (evaluating both):
"What have you seen from them that you liked? [Listen carefully]
That makes sense — they've invested heavily in [their strength]. What we hear from teams your size is that [our differentiator] tends to matter more once [triggering condition].
Would it be helpful to walk through [specific proof point or customer story] about that?"

LATE-PROCESS (they're leaning competitor):
"I want to be direct with you. If [their strength] is the primary driver, they may be the right fit and I'd rather tell you that than waste your time.
But there are two things I'd want you to see before you decide: [specific capability demo] and [customer story with direct comparison].
Can we spend 20 minutes on those two things?"

NEVER:
- Don't disparage the competitor directly. Reps who do that lose credibility.
- Don't lead with a feature list. Connect to their pain first.
- Don't be defensive. Acknowledge their strengths before pivoting.
```

### Phase 7: Proof Points and Escalation

**Proof to cite in competitive situations:**

For each major proof point, provide:
- What it proves
- The actual quote or metric
- When to use it

```
Proof Against [Competitor]:

1. Customer switch story:
   "[Company name] switched from [Competitor] after [time] because [reason]."
   "[Quote from customer]"
   Use when: Prospect has [Competitor] experience and is skeptical

2. Head-to-head outcome:
   "[Customer] evaluated both. After [POC/trial], chose us because [reason]."
   "[Metric: outcome achieved in X timeframe]"
   Use when: Prospect is running formal evaluation

3. Scale proof:
   "[Customer] started on [Competitor] and moved to us when they reached [threshold]."
   Use when: Discovery reveals growth trajectory that will hit [Competitor]'s ceiling

When to Involve PMM:
□ Prospect directly asks for side-by-side written comparison
□ Technical evaluation with [Competitor]'s SE team involved
□ [Competitor] is spreading false claims (document and escalate)
□ Deal is $X+ or strategic account
□ You're in a POC and hitting product limitations that aren't on this card
```

## Battlecard Maintenance Protocol

A stale battlecard is worse than no battlecard — reps stop trusting all competitive intel.

**Update triggers:**
- Competitor announces new product or major feature
- 3 reps report something on the card is wrong
- Win/loss data shows win rate against this competitor shifting
- Competitor raises or lowers pricing significantly
- Quarterly review regardless of above

**Keeping it current:**
- Build a Slack channel or form for reps to flag outdated info
- Review G2/Capterra reviews monthly for competitor signal
- Read competitor's blog, release notes, and job postings quarterly
- After every loss to this competitor, debrief the rep within 48 hours

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Build it backwards from the rep's experience** - What do they need to say in the moment?
- **Be honest about competitor strengths** - Reps lose trust when they encounter reality and it doesn't match the card
- **Distinguish segment fit** - Some competitors are better for certain customers; say so
- **Use real customer language** - Quotes beat summaries every time
- **Keep it to 1-2 pages** - A 10-page battlecard is a research document, not a battlecard
- **Include when to call PMM** - Reps need to know their limits and yours

### Don'ts
- **Don't make it a feature comparison table** - Those are reference documents, not battle tools
- **Don't bash the competitor** - It reads as insecure and prospects often know them
- **Don't include things you can't verify** - One wrong fact destroys trust in everything else
- **Don't skip their genuine strengths** - Incomplete intel backfires in the field
- **Don't create a card and never update it** - Stale cards are worse than no cards

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: The feature matrix trap**
Building a 30-row feature comparison that no one reads during a call
→ Solution: If it helps reps answer "what do I say right now?", it belongs. If not, cut it.

**Pitfall 2: Marketing language in rep tools**
"Our solution provides unparalleled scalability" — no rep says this
→ Solution: Write in first-person conversational language reps will actually use

**Pitfall 3: Building for wins only**
Only documenting why we win, not why we lose
→ Solution: Honest competitor strengths are where the most value is. Reps encounter those situations.

**Pitfall 4: No update process**
Cards go stale within 6 months without a maintenance system
→ Solution: Assign a card owner, build update triggers, create a rep feedback loop

**Pitfall 5: Too many cards, all shallow**
PMM creates cards for every competitor with superficial content
→ Solution: Do 3-5 competitors well before expanding. A great card for top competitors beats 20 mediocre ones.

## Interactive Approach

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **Start with the competitor's own voice** - What do they say about themselves? Read their materials.
2. **Force honest acknowledgment of strengths** - Challenge the instinct to minimize
3. **Connect weaknesses to outcomes, not features** - Not "lacks X" but "X means customers face Y"
4. **Demand real proof** - Not generic testimonials but specific competitive proof
5. **Write talk tracks in rep language** - Would a rep actually say this on a call?
6. **Plan for maintenance** - Who owns this card and when does it get reviewed?

## Skill Invocation Strategy

When invoked, guide the user through:
1. Identifying which competitor to build a card for and why (prioritize by deal frequency)
2. Gathering competitor intelligence through their own materials
3. Honestly assessing strengths — the hardest and most important step
4. Building differentiated value claims specifically against this competitor
5. Developing discovery questions and talk tracks in rep-ready language
6. Identifying proof points from win/loss data and customer stories
7. Planning a maintenance process

The goal is a battlecard that a sales rep trusts enough to reference mid-call, not a document that lives in a folder.
