# April Dunford Sales Pitch Framework Skill

## Overview
This skill implements April Dunford's methodology for building sales pitches that help buyers make confident decisions. Unlike traditional feature walkthroughs, this framework establishes market context and customer needs before demonstrating product capabilities. The approach addresses the root cause of "no decision" outcomes: buyer confusion about alternatives and trade-offs.

## When to Use This Skill
- Building a new sales deck or pitch structure
- Improving demo conversion rates
- Reducing "no decision" outcomes
- Training sales teams on discovery and demos
- Creating sales enablement materials
- Developing industry-specific pitch variations

## Key Insight: The "No Decision" Problem

**40-60% of B2B purchase processes end in "no decision"** - not because competitors win, but because buyers lack confidence in their decision. Traditional feature walkthroughs fail because they don't help buyers understand:
- What alternatives exist and their trade-offs
- Why differentiated features matter to their situation
- How to evaluate options confidently

This framework solves that problem by building market context BEFORE product demonstration.

## The 8-Component Sales Pitch Structure

The pitch divides into two parts:

### Part 1: The Setup (Components 1-3)
Establishes market context and buyer needs through discovery. **This should be conversational, not presented.**

### Part 2: The Follow-Through (Components 4-8)
Demonstrates how your product delivers differentiated value identified in the setup.

## Systematic Development Process

### Component 1: The Insight

**Key Principle:** Start with a market truth that helps buyers understand why your differentiated value matters. Not a fact about your company - a truth about the market.

Ask these questions:
- What market understanding distinguishes customers who value your solution from those who don't?
- What do your best customers "get" that others miss?
- What shift in thinking is required to appreciate your unique value?
- What conventional wisdom in your market is wrong or outdated?
- What do prospects need to believe for your differentiation to matter?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Is this about the market, not your product?
- Would prospects who don't understand this insight struggle to value your differentiation?
- Is this a genuine insight or just a feature description in disguise?
- Does this insight naturally lead to certain alternatives being inadequate?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- "Our product is better/faster/cheaper" (this is about you, not the market)
- Generic truths everyone already knows
- Insights that apply equally to competitors
- Technical insights that don't connect to business outcomes

**Example Output:**
```
Insight for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Market Truth: "Sales teams are drowning in contact data but starving for actual buying signals."

Why this matters:
- Most sales tools focus on quantity of contacts (emails, phone numbers)
- But conversion rates drop when reps can't identify who's actually in-market
- Buyers have gotten better at ignoring generic outreach
- The real competitive advantage is knowing WHO to contact and WHEN

Customers who understand this insight value our differentiated approach to behavioral signals over static contact databases. Those who don't understand it just see us as "another contact database."

This insight sets up why our alternative analysis and "perfect world" will differ from traditional sales intelligence vendors.
```

### Component 2: Alternatives

**Key Principle:** Map the real alternatives buyers consider - not just your competitors, but all the ways they might solve the problem. Present trade-offs objectively.

Ask these questions:
- What do buyers actually use when they don't buy from you?
- What did your current customers use before switching to you?
- What manual processes or workarounds exist?
- Is "do nothing" an alternative? Why do some buyers choose it?
- What are the honest pros and cons of each alternative?
- Which alternatives work well for which scenarios?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are you including non-obvious alternatives (spreadsheets, manual processes, doing nothing)?
- Are you presenting trade-offs honestly, not just bashing competitors?
- Does this alternative analysis connect to your earlier insight?
- Would a prospect recognize these as their actual decision context?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Only listing direct competitors by name
- Strawman alternatives that no one actually uses
- Presenting only cons with no pros
- Alternatives that don't reflect how customers actually think about the problem

**Example Output:**
```
Alternatives Analysis for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Alternative 1: Traditional Contact Databases (ZoomInfo, Apollo)
Best for: Teams that need volume of contacts for broad outreach
Pros:
- Comprehensive contact coverage
- Easy to export to CRM/sequences
- Familiar category with clear ROI model
Cons:
- No buying signal data (you're guessing who to contact)
- High cost for data that goes unused
- Doesn't solve the "who's in-market" problem from our insight

Alternative 2: DIY Research + LinkedIn Sales Navigator
Best for: Small teams with time to do manual research
Pros:
- Low cost (just labor + LinkedIn subscription)
- Flexible, can research exactly what you need
- Good for highly targeted account lists
Cons:
- Doesn't scale beyond 50-100 accounts
- No behavioral signals (still guessing timing)
- Sales time spent researching instead of selling

Alternative 3: Do Nothing (Use Inbound Leads Only)
Best for: Companies with strong inbound motion
Pros:
- No additional tooling cost
- Inbound leads are warmer
- Simple process
Cons:
- Limited TAM coverage
- Can't accelerate pipeline when growth stalls
- Competitors may be reaching your ideal customers first

Each alternative addresses part of the problem but has trade-offs. The question is: which trade-offs match your situation?
```

### Component 3: The Perfect World

**Key Principle:** Describe the ideal solution characteristics based on the insight and alternatives analysis. This becomes the buying criteria for best-fit customers.

Ask these questions:
- Based on the insight and alternatives, what would the ideal solution provide?
- What capabilities would eliminate the key trade-offs you identified?
- What would success look like from the buyer's perspective?
- What criteria should buyers use to evaluate solutions?
- How would the perfect solution be different from existing alternatives?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Does this naturally follow from the insight and alternatives discussion?
- Are you describing solution characteristics, not your specific product?
- Would prospects nod along and say "yes, that's what we need"?
- Does this set up your unique differentiation without explicitly stating it yet?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- This is just a description of your product
- Criteria that obviously only you can meet (too narrow)
- Generic "wish list" that doesn't connect to earlier context
- Features listed instead of outcomes or capabilities

**Example Output:**
```
The Perfect World for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Given the insight (need buying signals not just contacts) and the alternatives (volume vs. manual vs. inbound-only), the ideal solution would:

1. **Identify In-Market Accounts**
- Surface companies showing active buying behavior
- Not just contacts, but signals of intent
- Automated, not manual research

2. **Prioritize Who to Contact and When**
- Focus sales effort on accounts most likely to convert
- Timing intelligence (reach out when they're researching)
- Quality over quantity of outreach

3. **Integrate Behavioral Data with Contact Data**
- Don't choose between signals and contacts
- Combine "who's in-market" with "who to contact"
- Single platform, not stitching together multiple tools

4. **Scale Without Linear Cost**
- Not priced per contact seat (or you're back to the volume model)
- Cover broad TAM without breaking budget
- Accessible to teams of any size

This perfect world eliminates the core trade-offs: you get buying signals AND contacts, automation AND accuracy, scale AND affordability.
```

### Component 4: Introduction

**Key Principle:** Now introduce your company and product. Choose the format that best helps buyers understand your solution in context.

Three format options:
1. **Family of Products** - If you have multiple related products
2. **Platform Overview** - If you have a unified platform with components
3. **Marketecture** - If you fit into a broader ecosystem/tech stack

Ask these questions:
- How do buyers typically think about solutions in your category?
- Do you need to explain your company structure or can you go straight to product?
- What context helps buyers understand where you fit in their world?
- What format makes your differentiation most clear?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Is this introduction brief and context-setting, not a history lesson?
- Does it help buyers understand what's coming next?
- Are you clear about your market category (from your positioning)?
- Does this avoid "about us" fluff?

**Example Output:**
```
Introduction for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

"We're [Company Name], and we built what we call a Buyer Intent Platform.

[Shows simple diagram]
Unlike traditional contact databases that give you millions of contacts, or manual research that doesn't scale, we combine two data streams:

1. Behavioral signals → Who's researching solutions like yours right now
2. Contact + account data → Who to reach out to at those companies

Our platform has three main components:
- Intent Engine: Identifies accounts showing buying behavior
- Contact Intelligence: Surfaces best contacts at in-market accounts
- Activation Tools: Routes signals to your CRM and outreach tools

This means sales teams focus on accounts actually in-market, not guessing or blanketing their TAM with cold outreach.

Let me show you how this works..."
```

### Component 5: Differentiated Value

**Key Principle:** Demonstrate features that are BOTH different from alternatives AND valuable to the buyer. Focus on capabilities that deliver the "perfect world" you described.

Ask these questions:
- Which features are genuinely unique compared to the alternatives you discussed?
- How does each feature deliver on the "perfect world" criteria?
- What can buyers do with your solution they can't do with alternatives?
- How do you want to demonstrate this: demo + slides, demo only, or slides only?

**Presentation Format Decision:**
- **Demo + Slides**: Best for complex products where context is needed
- **Demo Only**: Best when product is intuitive and self-explanatory
- **Slides Only**: Best for high-level buyers or conceptual solutions

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are you only showing differentiated features, not feature parity?
- Does each capability clearly map to a "perfect world" criterion?
- Are you explaining business value, not just feature mechanics?
- Would alternatives struggle to deliver this same value?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Kitchen sink demo showing everything
- Features that don't connect to earlier setup
- Capabilities competitors also have
- Technical details without business context

**Example Output:**
```
Differentiated Value Demo for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Feature 1: Real-Time Intent Scoring
→ Delivers Perfect World #1 (Identify in-market accounts)
→ Different from alternatives: Not static firmographic data, actual behavioral signals
Demo: "See this account surge in intent score - they visited 12 competitor pages this week"
Value: Sales calls accounts when they're actively researching, not randomly

Feature 2: Contact Role Mapping at Intent Accounts
→ Delivers Perfect World #2 (Prioritize who to contact)
→ Different from alternatives: Auto-links intent to specific buying committee members
Demo: "For this high-intent account, here are the 4 people in the buying committee with direct contact info"
Value: Reach the right people at the right accounts at the right time

Feature 3: Workflow Automation to CRM
→ Delivers Perfect World #4 (Scale without linear cost)
→ Different from alternatives: No manual list building or research
Demo: "These 23 high-intent accounts auto-populated in your CRM this morning with playbook tasks"
Value: Sales wakes up to a prioritized list of who to call, no research time needed

[Skip showing features like "email integration" or "reporting dashboard" - those are table stakes, not differentiated]
```

### Component 6: Proof

**Key Principle:** Provide evidence that you can deliver the value you promise. Use customer stories that mirror the prospect's situation and reinforce differentiated value.

Ask these questions:
- Which customers best demonstrate the transformation you promise?
- What specific, quantified outcomes did they achieve?
- How does their story connect to your differentiated value?
- Which proof points address likely skepticism about your claims?
- Do you have customers similar to this prospect?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are metrics specific and credible, not vague percentages?
- Do case studies reference the differentiated features you just demoed?
- Is the customer's starting point similar enough to be relevant?
- Do you have multiple examples showing a pattern, not one outlier?

**Red Flags to Challenge:**
- Generic testimonials ("great product, great team")
- Metrics without context (100% increase from what baseline?)
- Customers too different from the prospect to be credible
- Proof that doesn't connect to your differentiated value

**Example Output:**
```
Proof for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Customer Story 1: TechCo (Mid-Market SaaS, similar size to prospect)
Starting Point: Using ZoomInfo, 1.2% cold email response rate, 90-day sales cycle
After Implementation:
- Response rates up to 4.7% (focused on high-intent accounts only)
- Sales cycle down to 47 days (reaching buyers already researching)
- 35% reduction in outreach volume (quality over quantity)
Proof Point: "We went from spray-and-pray to surgical strikes. Our reps know exactly who to call each morning." - VP Sales

Customer Story 2: Enterprise Co (Similar Industry)
Starting Point: 5-person SDR team doing manual research, could cover 200 accounts/month
After Implementation:
- Same team now covers 2,000+ accounts automatically
- Intent signals caught 67 opportunities that would have gone to competitors
- 3 SDRs reassigned to closing because research is automated
Metric: $2.3M pipeline from intent-driven outreach in first quarter

Pattern Across 50+ Customers:
- 3-4x improvement in response rates (focus on in-market accounts)
- 40-60% reduction in sales cycle length (timing advantage)
- 50%+ reduction in wasted outreach (no more guessing)

This isn't theoretical - this is the repeatable playbook.
```

### Component 7: Objections (Optional)

**Key Principle:** Proactively address concerns before prospects raise them. Only include if you have common, predictable objections.

Common objection categories:
- **Price**: "This seems expensive"
- **Adoption**: "Will our team actually use this?"
- **Integration**: "How does this work with our existing stack?"
- **Risk**: "What if the data is wrong?"
- **Change**: "We've tried something similar before and it didn't work"

Ask these questions:
- What objections come up in 80%+ of deals?
- Can you address these with proof points or explanations?
- Is it better to handle proactively or wait for them to ask?
- Do you have credible responses that don't sound defensive?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Are these real objections prospects raise, not ones you imagine?
- Are your responses credible and backed by evidence?
- Are you addressing concerns without creating new ones?
- Can these be woven into earlier components instead?

**Example Output:**
```
Proactive Objection Handling for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

Objection 1: "We already have ZoomInfo - why add another tool?"
Response: "Most of our customers keep their contact database. We're not replacing it - we're adding the 'when' layer. ZoomInfo tells you WHO exists; we tell you who's in-market RIGHT NOW. They're complementary. In fact, 70% of our customers integrate both."

Objection 2: "What if your intent data is wrong?"
Response: "Great question. Our intent score is based on 15+ behavioral signals, not just one data point. And we show you the underlying signals - 'visited these pages, downloaded this content, searched these terms' - so reps can judge for themselves. We've also back-tested: accounts with 70+ intent score are 8x more likely to close than cold outreach. Not perfect, but dramatically better than guessing."

Objection 3: "Our team is already overwhelmed with tools"
Response: "We actually reduce tools for most customers. You're likely using LinkedIn Sales Nav for research, manual account lists in spreadsheets, and maybe another intent tool. We consolidate that into a single workflow that feeds directly into your CRM. Most teams find this simplifies their process."
```

### Component 8: The Ask

**Key Principle:** Give prospects a clear next step with mutual commitment. Don't end with "what questions do you have?"

Typical next steps:
- **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Time-bound trial with success criteria
- **Expanded Demo**: Deeper dive for additional stakeholders
- **Technical Review**: Security, integration, infrastructure validation
- **Business Case Development**: ROI analysis and pricing discussion

Ask these questions:
- What's the natural next step for this stage of the sales process?
- What does the prospect need to see/do to move forward?
- What commitment can you ask for (their time, access, information)?
- How do you make the next step concrete and time-bound?

**Critical Evaluation:**
- Is the ask specific and actionable?
- Does it match where the prospect is in their journey?
- Are you asking for commitment, not just "following up"?
- Is the next step clear to both parties?

**Example Output:**
```
The Ask for [Sales Intelligence Platform]:

"Based on what we've discussed, I'd propose a 2-week proof of concept.

Here's how it works:
- Week 1: We'll set up intent tracking for your top 200 target accounts and integrate with your CRM
- Week 2: Your SDR team reaches out to high-intent accounts and we measure results vs. your current baseline

Success criteria: If we don't see at least 2x improvement in response rates and surface at least 5 qualified opportunities, we'll shut it down - no obligation.

To get started, I'd need:
- Your target account list (200 companies)
- CRM access for our integration team
- 2-3 SDRs willing to test for 2 weeks

Can you commit to that on your end, and we'll kick off next Monday?"

[Alternative for earlier-stage conversation]
"What I'd like to do is an expanded demo with your sales leadership team. I'll customize it around your specific target accounts and show you exactly what signals we'd be tracking. I can do that next Thursday - does 2pm work for you and your VP Sales?"
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- **Spend 40-50% of time in the setup** - This is where you earn the right to demo
- **Make setup conversational** - Ask questions, don't present the insight
- **Only demo differentiation** - Skip features competitors also have
- **Connect every feature to value** - Never show something without explaining business impact
- **Use customer language** - Incorporate how prospects describe problems
- **Make the ask concrete** - Specific action, specific timeline, specific commitment

### Don'ts
- **Don't start with "about us"** - Earn their attention first with insight
- **Don't show feature parity** - If competitors have it too, skip it
- **Don't do a feature walkthrough** - That's not a sales pitch, that's a tour
- **Don't end with "any questions?"** - That's not an ask, that's a wimpy ending
- **Don't skip the setup** - You'll just be another vendor doing a demo
- **Don't ignore "do nothing"** - It's often the real competition

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Skipping setup and jumping to demo**
Sales reps rush to "show the product" without establishing context
→ Solution: Train reps that setup IS selling, not just preamble to the demo

**Pitfall 2: Showing everything in the demo**
"Let me show you all our features" leads to overwhelming, undifferentiated demos
→ Solution: Only demo what's unique and valuable. Less is more.

**Pitfall 3: Insight is really about your product**
"Our unique approach is..." - that's not market insight
→ Solution: The insight should be true even if your company didn't exist

**Pitfall 4: Alternatives are strawmen**
Only showing bad options to make you look good
→ Solution: Present honest trade-offs. Credibility matters more than perfect positioning

**Pitfall 5: Perfect World is just your feature list**
Describing your product, not solution criteria
→ Solution: Write Perfect World before drafting differentiated value. It should lead to your solution without naming it.

**Pitfall 6: No clear ask**
Demo ends with vague "let us know if you're interested"
→ Solution: Every pitch needs a specific, time-bound next step

## Interactive Questioning Approach

When guiding someone through this framework, Claude should:

1. **Work through setup components thoroughly** - Don't rush to the demo
2. **Push for market insights, not product insights** - Challenge self-centered insights
3. **Demand honest alternative analysis** - Call out strawmen
4. **Ensure Perfect World follows from setup** - Test logical flow
5. **Ruthlessly cut non-differentiated features** - Demo should be short and focused
6. **Require specific proof** - No vague testimonials
7. **Make the ask concrete** - Push for specific commitment

## Example Critical Dialogue Flow

**Claude:** "Let's start with your insight. What market truth do prospects need to understand for your differentiation to matter?"

**User:** "Our product is faster and more accurate than competitors."

**Claude:** "That's a claim about your product, not a market insight. What do your best customers understand about the MARKET that makes speed and accuracy important to them? What truth about their world makes those things valuable?"

**User:** "Well, they're dealing with real-time data that goes stale quickly."

**Claude:** "Better - now we're talking about the market. Let's develop that. What's changing about data freshness requirements? Why is this suddenly more important than it was a few years ago?"

[Continue through each component with similar depth and critical engagement]

## Relationship to Positioning

This sales pitch framework BUILDS ON positioning (see `/dunford-positioning` skill):
- **Positioning defines** your competitive alternatives, differentiation, and target market
- **Sales pitch uses** that positioning to structure buyer conversations

If you haven't done positioning work, start there. The sales pitch will be much easier to build with clear positioning as the foundation.

## Skill Invocation Strategy

When invoked, guide the user through:
1. Building each component sequentially
2. Critically evaluating each response
3. Ensuring logical flow from setup to follow-through
4. Cutting ruthlessly to focus on differentiation
5. Producing a complete pitch document

The goal is a sales pitch that helps buyers make confident decisions, not just a product demo that showcases features.
